From 1961 to 1990 he worked at the Institute of Control Sciences, Moscow, where he became Head of the Computer Science Research Department. He then joined AT&T Bell Laboratories , Holmdel, NJ, where he now continues as a Consultant, having been appointed Professor of Computer Science and Statistics at Royal Holloway in 1995.\n\nProfessor Vapnik has taught and researched in computer science, theoretical and applied statistics for over 30 years. He has published 6 monographs and over a hundred research papers. His major achievements have been the development of a general theory for minimizing the expected risk of losses using empirical data, and a new type of learning machine called Support Vector machine that possesses a high level of generalization ability. These techniques have been used to solve many pattern recognition and regression estimation problems and have been applied to the problems of dependency estimation, forecasting, and constructing intelligent machines.\n\nHe was one of the invited speakers at the Colloquium \"The Importance of being Learnable\" hosted by the Computer Learning Research Centre at Royal Holloway in September 1998. His current research is presented in his latest book \"Statistical Learning Theory\", ISBN No: 0-471-03003-1.\n\nOn the 10th of February 2006 the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) of USA elected Professor Vapnik as a new member for \"insights into the fundamental complexities of learning and for inventing practical and widely applied machine-learning algorithms\".",

Smith). His empirical findings challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory.With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman established a cognitive basis for common human errors that arise from heuristics and biases (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Kahneman, Slovic & Tversky, 1982; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), and developed prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory.In 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers.In the same year, his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best seller.He is professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School.

            "bio": "Krzysztof (Kris) Matyjaszewski is an internationally recognized polymer chemist. He is perhaps best known for the discovery of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), a novel method of polymer synthesis that has dramatically changed the way such molecules are made.\n\nMatyjaszewski received his doctorate from the Center of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1976 and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Florida in 1977. From 1978 to 1984, he was a research associate of the Polish Academy of Sciences. From 1984 to 1985, Matyjaszewski held appointments at the University of Paris, first as a research associate and then as a visiting professor. In 1985, he joined the chemistry department at Carnegie Mellon. He founded and currently directs the university's Center for Macromolecular Engineering. This Center is funded both by an active consortium and government agencies, including the National Science Foundation. In 1998, Matyjaszewski was appointed the J.C. Warner Professor of Natural Sciences. In 2004 he was named a University Professor, the highest distinction faculty can achieve at Carnegie Mellon. Mayjaszewski is also an adjunct professor in Carnegie Mellon's department of materials science and engineering.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1998, Matyjaszewski served as head of the Department of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon and assisted in recruiting additional faculty with strengths in polymer chemistry. At the same time, he formed a research consortium with various industrial corporations to expand the understanding of controlled radical polymerization, including ATRP, and accelerate the transfer of this technology to different commercial applications. A second consortium, the CRP Consortium, formed under his leadership in 2001, continues and expands these efforts, training university and industrial scientists in procedures for responsive polymeric material development.Matyjaszewski is a co-inventor on 51 issued U.S. patented technologies, holds 143 international patents and has 36 active U.S. patent applications.\n\nOne of the leading educators in the field of polymer chemistry, Matyjaszewski has 14 current doctoral students and 5 postdoctoral fellows. He has mentored more than 200 undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students since joining Carnegie Mellon. He has authored 17 books, 83 book chapters and more than 870 peer-reviewed scientific papers. His work has been cited in the scientific literature more than 68,000 times, making him one of the most cited chemists in the world.\n\nMatyjaszewski has received numerous awards for his work, including the 2012 Dannie-Heineman Prize from the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, 2011 Wolf Prize in Chemistry and the 2009 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award. He has been honored by the American Chemical Society (ACS) with its inaugural AkzoNobel North America Science Award in 2013, 2011 Applied Polymer Science Award, 2007 Hermann F. Mark Senior Scholar Award, 2004 Cooperative Research Award in Polymer Science & Engineering, 2002 Polymer Chemistry Award, and the 1995 Carl S. Marvel Creative Polymer Chemistry Award. He also received the 2005 UK Macro Medal for outstanding achievements in polymer science, 1995 Humboldt Award for Senior U.S. Scientists and a 1989 Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation. In 2006, he was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, in 2014 a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors, in 2010 a fellow in the ACS Polymer Division, and in 2001 he was elected an ACS Polymeric Materials Science and Engineering Fellow.[citation needed] He is also a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and an honorary member of the Chinese Chemical Society and Israel Chemical Society.\n\nMatyjaszewski’s work has been recognized in his native country of Poland. In 2004, he received the Annual Prize of the Foundation of Polish Science, the most prestigious scientific award in Poland, referred to as the Polish Nobel Prize. In 2005 he became a foreign member of the Polish Academy of Science, and in 2007, he received an honorary degree from Polytechnic University of Lodz in Poland. He has also received honorary degrees from the University of Ghent, Belgium, Russian Academy of Sciences, University of Athens, Greece, Polytechnic Institute in Toulouse, France, and Pusan National University in South Korea.",

Schneider, Distinguished Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics, has been appointed as head of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Penn State's Eberly College of Science. Schneider succeeds Lawrence W. Ramsey, who has served as head of the department since 2003.\n\nSchneider, whose primary research interest is observational cosmology, perhaps is best known for three of his accomplishments: He developed a new technique to measure distances to galaxies; he was the first to detect Comet Halley as it approached Earth in 1982, at a greater distance than any comet had ever been detected up to that time; and he has broken his own and others' records numerous times in the discovery of the most-distant known object in the universe.\n\nSchneider now is particularly interested in finding and determining the properties of distant quasars, which are thought to be massive black holes that are swallowing stars as they venture to close to the black hole. He uses optical telescopes as time machines to view the distant past, when the universe was only a small fraction of its current size and age.\n\nFor the past two decades, much of his research effort has been devoted to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which is a large international effort to produce a comprehensive digital map of the sky. Schneider has served as the chairman of the quasar science group and as the science publications coordinator for the project. The first two phases of the survey, completed in July 2008, identified 100,000 quasars -- the most luminous objects known in the universe -- and have measured the distances to over a million galaxies. During the third phase of the survey, which is ongoing until May 2014, Schneider is serving two roles: as the project's survey coordinator and as a member of its Management Council. Since 2004, Schneider also has served as the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Scientist.\n\nIn 2006, Schneider received a C.I. Noll Award for Excellence in Teaching, which is sponsored by the Eberly College of Science Student Council and Alumni Society and is presented annually to faculty members and instructors in the Eberly College of Science who demonstrate a record of excellence both in teaching and in their interactions with students. For the past several years, Schneider has taught a year-long introductory course for astronomy majors and has been active in placing students in research programs throughout the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nSchneider received a bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics, with highest distinction, from the University of Nebraska in 1976 and, in 2002, he received the University's Alumni Achievement Award. He received a doctoral degree in astronomy from the California Institute of Technology in 1982 and was a research fellow there from 1982 to 1985. From 1985 to 1994, he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

Flowers University Professor at Harvard,[12] one of only 24 University Professorships at the institution as of 2014.[13] He is cofounder and director of the Whitesides Research Group at Harvard, an active research group of graduate and postdoctoral students with a lab space covering more than 6,000 square feet (560 m2).[4] The single primary objective of his lab is \"to fundamentally change the paradigms of science.\"[14]\n\nWhitesides' interests include \"physical and organic chemistry, materials science, biophysics, complexity and emergence, surface science, microfluidics, optics, self-assembly, micro- and nanotechnology, science for developing economies, catalysis, energy production and conservation, origin of life, rational drug design, cell-surface biochemistry, simplicity, and infochemistry.\"[9] He has shifted to new research areas many times throughout his career, averaging about ten years in any particular area. Once other people successfully move into an area, he tends to look for new and more interesting problems to solve.[6] \"He has done that repeatedly by asking fundamental questions of what seemed to everyone to be virtually intractable problems,\" according to Jeremy R. Knowles.[6]\n\nWhitesides has made scientific contributions in diverse areas, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), microfluidics and nanotechnology. He is particularly well known for his work in materials and surface science. His work in surface chemistry has examined the 'self-assembly' processes of molecules arranging themselves on a surface. This work has become a basis for developments in nanoscience, electronics, pharmaceutical science and medical diagnostics.[15] Some of his research has been visually presented through the collaboration On the Surface of Things: Images of the Extraordinary in Science with photographer and artist Felice Frankel.[16] One image, a pattern of blue and green water droplets, was featured on a 1992 cover of Science.[17]\n\nEarly work by Ralph G. Nuzzo and David L. Allara on spontaneously organized molecular assemblies informed Whitesides' work on soft lithography.[6] Whitesides and his research group have made significant contributions by developing techniques for soft lithography and microcontact printing. Both microscale and nanoscale techniques are based on printing, molding and embossing, and can be used for the fabrication of patterns and features on many different materials. Soft lithography uses a patterned elastomer as a stamp, mold, or mask to create micropatterns and microstructures.[18][19] Such techniques have now become standard in the field.[6]\n\nMore recent research interests include energy,[20] the origin of life,[21] and science for developing economics.[22]\n\nWhitesides is also known for publishing his \"outline system\" for writing scientific papers.[23]",

Roberts.[5] At Caltech, Whitesides began working in organic chemistry. Whitesides' graduate work in organometallic chemistry used NMR spectroscopy and density matrices to study Grignard reagents.[6] He used NMR spectroscopy to study rate of change of Grignard reagents[7] and the structure of Grignard reagents in solution. He also studied spin-spin coupling in a variety of organic compounds, using density matrix calculations to examine the spin systems that NMR analyses detect.[6]",

            "bio": "In the hallways at scientific meetings, countless scientists have debated the same question: \"How many species need to be sequenced to know whether evolution has conserved a given stretch of DNA?\" One computational biologist, Sean Eddy, has done the math. \n\nIn the January 2005 issue of PLoS Biology, Eddy, who at the time was an HHMI investigator at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, described a mathematical model that puts hard numbers on the need to keep sequencing genomes from diverse organisms. According to the model, in order to detect invariant single nucleotides conserved in evolution, researchers would need to compare about 17 genomes separated by the average evolutionary distance between humans and mice. \n\nWhat's more, more than two dozen genomes are needed to do the same job when conserved nucleotides are allowed to change at a more rapid, realistic rate. To reduce the error rate from 1 in 100 to 1 in 10,000, about 120 such genomes should be compared. Notably, far fewer genomes are required to detect conserved features larger than a single nucleotide. \n\nFor Eddy, huge numbers—not to mention the letters A, T, C, and G—are all in a day's work. He designs mathematical tools to probe modern genomes, unraveling the structures, functions, and histories of specific genes. In particular, Eddy works to identify genes that make functional RNAs instead of proteins. \n\nTo identify noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes, for example, Eddy's lab has developed statistical models describing the pattern of mutation expected in these genes versus the different mutation patterns commonly found in protein genes. With these models, they can scan genome regions to find areas that likely contain ncRNA genes. Eddy's team has used this approach to predict a few hundred new RNA genes in the genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli, some of which they've confirmed experimentally. The lab also is conducting computational screens for new ncRNA genes in humans, nematodes, and yeast, among other organisms. Because ncRNA genes tend to be small and are inherently immune to frameshift or nonsense mutations, they are hard to find by classical mutational genetic screens. They are also difficult to recognize in genomes because they do not have open reading frames and thus cannot be discovered by gene-finding programs. \n\nAs a group leader at Janelia Farm, Eddy will bring his research program—and considerable computational savvy—to the new campus. He anticipates being a high-tech service provider, fulfilling some of the needs of the other group leaders, such as comparing given gene sequences across genomes. \n\nAlthough Eddy does not yet have a defined research plan for his Janelia Farm lab, he's planning to branch out—or back, as the case may be. As a postdoctoral fellow at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge during the 1990s, Eddy originally planned to study the neural circuits behind basic behaviors such as learning and memory, but his research project got scooped by a colleague with similar interests. \n\n\"My dream is to switch back to what I set out to do in the first place,\" Eddy says. \"At Janelia Farm, I can integrate my work with neurobiology, and I can take my time in developing a research program.\" He's also drawn to Janelia Farm for the promise of a culture of collaboration and focused science. \"The Farm is unique because it will have a whole research enterprise designed, from the ground up, to invent new technologies alongside science.\"\n",

Pearl is recognized for his work in artificial intelligence and philosophy of science, especially through the invention of Bayesian networks, a formalism that enables computers to reason with uncertainty. He is also credited with developing a calculus of causation that has algorithmitized counterfactuals and allows empirical scientists to quantify and discover cause-effect relationships from statistical data. Pearl was born in Israel, in 1936, and graduated from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, in 1960, with a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering. He came to the United State in 1960 to do post graduate work and received a Master degree in Physics from Rutgers university and a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now NYU-Poly). Until 1969, he held research positions at RCA David Sarnoff Research Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey and Electronic Memories, Inc, Hawthorne, California. Pearl has joined the faculty of UCLA in 1969, where he currently directs the Cognitive Systems Laboratory. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and a Founding Fellow of the American Institute of Artificial Intelligence.

He also served as the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs in the College of Pharmacy at Purdue.  \n\n\nRich’s research was focused on mechanistic and inhibitory studies of protein prenyltransferases and related enzyme targets, and the design and synthesis of chemical probes of protein prenylation.  Many key signal transduction proteins are modified by prenylation of a cysteine residue, followed by a specific proteolytic cleavage step and finally methylation. This has led to intense interest in protein-farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitors as potential cancer chemotherapeutic agents, and such compounds are currently in human clinical trials. Rich’s laboratory employed chemical biology approaches to address two key questions in the field of protein prenylation. They explored the substrate specificity of FTase, with the goal of developing potential isoprenoid-based inhibitors or modulators of protein prenylation. Secondly, they used synthetic isoprenoid analogues and labeled derivatives as probes of the biological function of protein prenylation. Rich also developed a new stereospecific route to isoprenoids to synthesize novel, specifically substituted analogues of FPP, the isoprenoid substrate of FTase. This program led to the development of a series of potent inhibitors of FTase and farnesol analogues that are potent inhibitors of the growth of certain human tumor cells in vitro.",

He wrote the first paper on systolic architectures with H.T. Kung and invented the retiming method for digital circuit optimization. He designed and led the implementation of the network architecture for the Connection Machine Model CM-5 Supercomputer produced by Thinking Machines Corporation, which incorporated the fat-tree interconnection network he developed at MIT. Fat-trees are now the preferred interconnect strategy for Infiniband technology. His textbook, Introduction to Algorithms, coauthored with Ronald L. Rivest and Thomas H. Cormen was named \"Best 1990 Professional and Scholarly Book in Computer Science and Data Processing\" by the Association of American Publishers. Currently in its third edition with an additional coauthor Clifford Stein, it has sold over 500,000 copies and, according to Citeseerx, is the second most cited publication in computer science. On leave from MIT as Director of System Architecture at the Internet start-up Akamai Technologies, he led the engineering team that developed a world-wide content-distribution network numbering over 20,000 servers. He introduced the notion of cache-oblivious algorithms, which exploit the memory hierarchy near optimally while containing no tuning parameters for cache size or cache-line length. He developed the Cilk multithreaded programming technology, which featured the first provably efficient work-stealing scheduler. He led the development of several Cilk-based parallel chess-playing programs which have won numerous prizes in international competition. With his former student Matteo Frigo, he founded Cilk Arts, Inc., which developed the Cilk++ multicore concurrency platform and was acquired by Intel Corporation in 2009. He was for many years the head of the computer-science program for the Singapore-MIT Alliance distance-education collaboration. His annual workshop on Leadership Skills for Engineering and Science Faculty, cotaught with Chuck McVinney, has educated hundreds of faculty at MIT and around the world in the nontechnical issues involved in leading technical teams in academia. He is a Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellow at MIT, the highest recognition at MIT for undergraduate teaching. He is an ACM Fellow and a senior member of IEEE and SIAM.",

This expansion gives rise to a small benign colon tumor (called a polyp or adenoma). This clonal expansion and subsequent growth of the tumors appears to be caused by mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and the whole process is accelerated by defects in genes required for maintaining genetic instability.  Mutations in four or five such genes are required for a malignant tumor to form, while fewer mutations suffice for benign tumorigenesis. As the mutations accumulate, the tumors become progressively more dangerous.\n\nCurrent studies are aimed at further characterization of the mechanisms through which these genes act, the identification of other genes that play a role in this tumor type, and the application of this knowledge to patient management.    Genetic tests for risk assessment, pre-symptomatic detection of tumors, and prognosis have been devised and are constantly being improved.  Novel therapeutic agents that target the specific defects in cancer are under development.",

            "bio": "Klaus Schulten is a leader in the field of computational biophysics, having devoted over 40 years to establishing the physical mechanisms underlying processes and organization in living systems from the atomic to the organism scale. Schulten is a strong proponent of the use of simulations as a \"computational microscope\", to augment experimental research, and to lead to discoveries that could not be made through experiments so far. The molecular dynamics and structure analysis programs NAMD and VMD, born and continuously developed in his group, are used today by many thousands of researchers across the world. Schulten contributed key discoveries to several areas of biological physics: from quantum biology of vision, photosynthesis, and animal navigation to ion channels employed in neural signaling and to neural network organization of brain function; from mechanically gated channel proteins to muscle protein mechanics; from mathematical physics of non-equilibrium processes to numerical mathematics of the classical many-body problem. While Schulten's work remains solidly anchored to molecular detail, his most recent work has advanced to molecular cell biology and molecular systems biology via his group's structure analysis method, Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting, applied to systems such as the 300,000 atom ribosome and 4 million atom asymmetric HIV capsid. As of 2013, Schulten's work in biological physics has produced over 650 publications, which have been cited over 75,000 times (Google Scholar) as of February 2015. Schulten believes strongly in the importance of educating the next generation of scientists, having graduated 80 PhD students so far, many today in distinguished academic positions. He developed new courses and textbooks, and organizes a popular series of hands-on training workshops in which he has trained, in small groups, over 1,000 young scientists.",

His current research is focused on the mathematical analysis and modeling of the combinatorial structure of networks and information. His recent work includes an improvement to the HITS algorithm which he developed at IBM's Almaden Research Laboratory as a Visiting Scientist in the CLEVER project. HITS is a very influential algorithm of his, conceptually similar to the PageRank algorithm of Larry Page and Sergey Brin. In fact, some credit Kleinberg's work as the inspiration for PageRank.\n\nMany students affectionately call him the \"Rebel King\" (an anagram for \"Kleinberg\"). The \"Rebel King\" phenomenon began in an undergraduate course taught by Jon Kleinberg, when an unknown student entered the lecture hall in the middle of the class, announced in a loud voice that \"Kleinberg is Rebel King,\" and then promptly left the lecture hall. The \"Rebel King\" tradition continued in subsequent years, when subsequent classes taught by Jon Kleinberg received similar visits from an unknown student who again announced loudly that \"Kleinberg is Rebel King\" before making a rapid exit. While co-teaching a class with Eva Tardos students also made an anagram of her name \"Astro Dave\" which has not caught on. The most recent of these incidents occurred on |March 9, |2007 when two unknown students, shirtless and adorned with red paint,entered the lecture hall of Kleinberg's class on network structures, chanted \"Long Live the Rebel King\" and ran out another exit. Kleinberg's popularity among students is due in part to his excellence in teaching, which was formally recognized when Cornell's Association of Computer Science Undergraduates awarded him the \"Faculty of the Year\" award in 2002.\n\nHe has written numerous prominent papers and articles, including a recent textbook on algorithms, Algorithm Design, co-authored with Éva Tardos and published by Addison-Wesley.\n\nHis work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, and grants from the NSF.

            "bio": "My main work in the field of protein sequence analysis and more particularily in the development of databases and software tools for this purpose. My first project, as a Ph.D student was the development of PC/Gene, an MS-DOS based software package for the analysis of protein and nucleotide sequences. PC/Gene was commercialized, first by a Swiss company (Genofit) then by Intelligenetics in the US which was later bought by Oxford Molecular.\nWhile working on PC/Gene I started to develop an annotated protein sequence database which became SWISS-PROT. It was first released in July 1986. From 1988 onward it has been a collaborative project with the Data Library group of the EMBL which has now became the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). SWISS-PROT has grown both in size, in its scope and in the amount of work and people necessary to produce it.\n\nIn 1988, I started to develop PROSITE, a database of protein families and domains. A little while later I created ENZYME, a nomenclature database on enzymes as well as SeqAnalRef, a sequence analysis bibliographic reference database.\n\nIn collaboration with Ron Appel we initiated, in August 1993, the first molecular biology WWW server, ExPASy. What was intended as a prototype grew rapidely into a major site that provides access to the many databases produced partially or completely in Geneva as well as many tools for the analysis of proteins (proteomics).\n\nIn the last four years I was involved with colleagues in Geneva and Lausanne in setting-up the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), whose mission is to establish in Switzerland a center of excellence in the field of bioinformatics with an emphasis on research, education, services and the developments of databases and tools. I am currently one of the six group leaders of the SIB.\n\nIn November 1997, together with Ron Appel and Denis Hochstrasser we founded GeneBio (Geneva Bioinformatics SA), a company involved in biological knowledge.\n\nIn April 2000, the above persons with Keith Rose and Robin Offord founded GeneProt (Geneva Proteomics), a high throughput proteomics company.\n",

            "bio": "高德纳1938年1月10日生于威斯康辛州密歇根湖畔的密尔沃基(Milwaukee)。这是一个山灵水秀、人才辈出的地方，“人工智能之父”、诺贝尔奖获得者西蒙(H．A．Simon)也是在这里出生的，获诺贝尔奖次年获图灵奖。但高德纳比西蒙小整整22岁，是一个“小字辈”。高德纳的父亲是一个多才多艺的人，有研究生学历，当过小学和中学教师，星期天在教堂演奏风琴，还在自家地下室办了一个小印刷厂。受父亲影响，高德纳从小喜欢学习和音乐，并表现出与众不同的才能。高德纳上8年级时，当地的Ziegler糖果厂为了促销其称为Giant Bar的一种棒棒糖，在学校中搞了一个比赛，看谁能用Ziegler’s Giant Bar中的字母排列组合出最多的单词。高德纳假装胃疼，在家里呆了两个星期，利用一部大字典，得出了4500个单词，比裁判掌握的2 000个单词多出一倍多，一举为他所在的班夺得冠军，赢得一台电视机和每人一块Giant Bar，而高德纳本人则赢得一付雪撬。\n1956年，高德纳以各科平均97．5的创记录的高分从密尔沃基路德兰高级中学毕业，进入俄亥俄州克利夫兰的开思理工学院(Case Institute of Technology)攻读物理。这一年，他在中学时就创作的一篇出色的科学幻想小说“普茨比度量衡体系”(The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures)在美国著名的《疯狂》(Mad)杂志上发表，高德纳获得了他的第一笔稿费25美元，并因而获得西屋科学天才的提名奖。在这篇小说中，高德纳风趣而富于幻想地提出了替代公制的一种新的计量制度，比如以一本流行杂志的厚度为长度单位，虽然滑稽可笑，却设计得严密周到，天衣无缝，其中甚至还包括一种新的历法。文章刊出后大受欢迎，多次重印，1991年还重印过一次，其时作者高德纳即将退休。\n大学一年级结束以后的暑假，高德纳在学校打工，负责把统计数字画成图表。碰巧他工作室的隔壁就是计算机房，新到了一台IBM650。当时的计算机体积都很庞大，有供输入和调试的控制台，上面排列着一排排的开关和指示灯，计算机工作时指示灯快速闪烁变化出不同的图案，这引起高德纳极大的好奇与兴趣，他接连好几天彻夜不眠地呆在机房，观察它的工作，钻研使用手册，探究计算机的奥秘。一年以后，他终于改学数学，与计算机结缘。这段经历对于高德纳是如此重要和关键，以致他在《计算机程序设计的艺术》第一卷的卷首，不像别的作者那样一般写上“献给自己的父母”或“献给自己的妻子”，而是写着“献给曾经安装在开思理工学院的650型计算机，以纪念那些愉快的夜晚”。他的第一个计算机应用程序也是在650计算机上实现的：他为他所在的校篮球队(高德纳人高马大，也喜爱运动,娱乐)设计了一个复杂的公式，根据球员在每场比赛中的得分、助攻、抢断、篮板球、盖帽等多项统计数字对球员进行综合评估。球队教练根据高德纳的程序挑选和使用球员，使开思理工学院在1960年赢得了联赛冠军，高德纳的“神奇的公式和程序”也被当地报纸和广播传为美谈。\n1960年，高德纳在开思理工学院毕业，不但被授予学士学位，还被破例同时授予硕士学位。之后他进入加州理工学院研究生院，1963年获得博士学位，留校工作至1968年，然后转入斯坦福大学任教，其间1972—1973年曾经在奥斯陆大学当客座教授。\n高德纳至今进行了两大工程，一个已经完成，一个尚未完成。第一个大工程就是《计算机程序设计的艺术》系列，开始于他念博士期间，计划出七卷，第一卷《基本算法》于1968年出版，第二卷《半数字化算法》于1969年出版，第三卷《排序与搜索》于1973年出版，第四卷A《组合算法》已于2011年出版。这个工程为什么前紧后松，长期停顿呢?\n高德纳暂停了写作，理由是现有的计算机排版软件效果太差，破坏了这套书的美。这不免引发作者是否江郎才尽，见好就收的猜测与怀疑——不料辍笔10年的高德纳以三个重量级创造性成果：字体设计系统METAFONT（其价值一言以蔽之：对整个西文印刷行业带来了革命性变革）、文学化编程（充分展示程序设计的艺术性：清晰，美感，诗意），尤其是最具革命性的排版系统TEX（至今仍是全球学术排版的不二之选）给出了强力回应。尽管如此，仍有人说高写完三卷 TAOCP就去研究TeX，其实是害怕写第四卷——不过他对这类风言风语根本不以为意：“一个人要把事情做的完美，只有跟上帝的意图保持和谐，现在上帝要我去写第四卷了。”\n搁置手头的重要工作，费时10年专研排版美学打造TEX系统，原因其实很简单：数理图文排版以前一直使用金属活字，70年代以降始有激光照排，然而当时的计算机虽能替代人工排出普通的报纸杂志，但对处理复杂的数理公式却力不从心。高德纳试图为计算机写一个小玩艺儿解决上述问题，TeX的前半部分由此产生。编写过程中，他想参考J·伯克霍夫的Aesthetic Measures（《美学标准》）一书，在哈佛的图书馆几经查阅也未能如愿，之后好不容易在麻省理工学院找到。参考的结果是在TeX里加入一个变量badness，用以衡量一行文字的美感，变量越小文字就越美。\n20世纪70年代中期，高德纳和其他一些计算机科学家曾经设想在未来10年中将产生一种比现有程序设计语言更加强大，更加优美的新型语言，并预先命名它为“乌托邦84'’(Utopia 84)语言。\n1992年，高为潜心写作TAOCP从斯坦福提前退休，同时停用电子邮箱(他自1975年就开始玩电邮)。2008年，TAOCP前三卷出版30年后，第四卷在高粉的千呼万唤中终于面世，此际的高德纳已然是满头白发。对计算机科学的倾心热爱，使他为这部作品耗费了毕生心血：从及冠之年直至古稀老人。",

            "work": "高德纳的著作很多，除了已由Addison-Wesley出版社出版的三卷The Art of Computer Programming（由管纪文、苏运霖等译成中文，国防工业出版社出版，介绍TEX和METAFONT的五卷《计算机与排版》(Computers and Typesetting)早已流传于世外，还有以下一些主要著作：\n《研究之美》(Surreal Numbers，Addison-Wesley，1974)\n《具体数学》(Concrete Mathematics，Addison-Wesley，1989)\n《数学论著集》(Mathematical Writings，MAA，1989)\n《用于算法分析的数学》(Mathematics for the Analysis of Algorithms，Birkhauser，1990，第三版)\n《作文式程序设计》(Literate Programming，CSLI，1992)\n《公理与外壳》(Axioms and Hulls，Springer，1992)\n《斯坦福的GraphBase：组合计算用的平台》(The Stanford Graph Base：a Platform for Combinatorial Computing，ACMh·，1993)\n其中，《研究之美》（Surreal Numbers）一书介绍了剑桥大学的康韦(J．H．Conway)所发明的一种新的数制，是高德纳听了康韦向他作的介绍后，用了一周时间写成的小说体裁的作品。有评论家指出，这是历史上第一次一个重大的数学发现以小说的形式向公众进行介绍。由此可见，高德纳的艺术才华同样是非凡的，要不是计算机深深吸引了他，高德纳很可能会成为出色的小说家或音乐家。高德纳获得的荣誉与奖励极多。ACM除了授予他图灵奖和软件系统奖外，还在1971年授予过他以COBOL的发明人、女计算机科学家霍泼(Grace Murray Hopper)命名的奖项，这个奖项是专门奖励30岁以下的优秀青年计算机科学家的。这样，高德纳一人就先后获得ACM的三个奖项，在1999年以前，这是计算机科学家中仅有的一位(1999年，布鲁克斯获得图灵奖，从而也拥有ACM三个奖项，平了高德纳的记录)。无独有偶，美国数学会也先后授予高德纳三个奖项，即Lester R．Ford奖(1975)、J．B．Priestley奖(1981)和Steele奖(1986)。1979年，当时的美国总统卡特向他颁发了全国科学奖章。IEEE授过他两个奖：McDowell奖(1980)和计算机先驱奖(1982)。1994年，瑞典科学院授予高德纳Adelskold奖。1995年他获得冯·诺伊曼奖和Harvey奖。1996年他获得日本INAMORI基金会设立的KYOTO奖，这个奖是专门奖励在高科技领域作出贡献的科学家的。面对这么多荣誉，高德纳都以平常心对待，据说，纪念他获得图灵奖的碗现在只是被他用来盛放水果。\nACM于1974年11月11日在南加利福尼亚濒临太平洋的海港城市圣迭戈举行的年会上向高德纳颁发图灵奖。高德纳发表了题为“作为一种艺术的计算机程序设计”(Computer Programming as an Art)的演说。在演说中，一如我们在阅读他的著作时所感受的那样，高德纳旁征博引，有根有据，人情人理，娓娓道来，把“科学”与“艺术”的不可分割的关系说得清清楚楚，令人心服口服。演说刊于Communications of ACM，1975年12月，667—673页，或见《前20年的ACM图灵奖演说集》(ACM Turing Award Lectures——The First 20Years：1966--1985，ACM h．)，33—46页。此外，高德纳还有许多“小创造”。计算机科学技术中两个最基本的概念：“算法”(Algorithm)和“数据结构”(Data Structure)就是高德纳于29岁时提出来的。1973年他首创双向链表。在编译器设计方面，著名的LR(k)文法也是高德纳在对自左至右、自底向上的移进一归约分析进行了深刻剖析的基础上，经过高度概括和集中以后发明的，它表示具有从左(L)到右(R)的分析而向前看k个符号，以确定所要进行的归约和应用何种语法解释。LR(k)文法的识别效率高，在从左至右扫描输入串时，就能发现其中的语法错误，并能准确地指出出错位置，因此被广泛应用。此外，利用LR(众)文法还能正确区分像Flying planes is fun和Flying planes can crash这类句子(前一个句子“开飞机很有趣”中flying是动名词，而后一个句子“飞行中的飞机可能出事”中Flying是现在分词当形容词)。以著名的巴克斯—诺尔范式为基础的“属性文法”(attribute grammar)也是高德纳首先提出来的。属性文法在普通的上下文无关文法(context-free grammar)的基础上，对每一个终结点或非终结点加上一些属性，和对这些属性进行估值的语义规则集，从而形成一种新的、有更强表达与描述能力的文法。其中属性是由的有序偶对组成的。属性的内容则可包括模式标识符表等。\n在算法方面，有他和他的学生共同设计的诸如Knuth-Bendix算法和Knuth-Morris-Pratt算法，前者是为了考察数学公理及其推论是否“完全”而构造标准重写规则集(rewriting rule set)的算法，曾成功地用它解决了群论中的等式的证明问题，是定理机器证明的一个范例。后者是在文本中查找字符串的简单而高效的算法。此外，高德纳还设计与实现过最早的随机数发生器(random number generator)。",

Dehaene was one of ten people to be awarded the James S. McDonnell Foundation Centennial Fellowship[3] in 1999 for his work on the \"Cognitive Neuroscience of Numeracy\". In 2003, together with Denis Le Bihan, Dehaene was awarded the Louis D. Prize from the Institut de France.[4] In 2014, together with Giacomo Rizzolatti and Trevor Robbins, he was awarded the brain prize.Dehaene is best known for his work on numerical cognition, a discipline which he popularized and synthesized with the publication of his 1997 book, The Number Sense (La Bosse des maths) which won the Prix Jean-Rostand (fr) for best French language general-audience scientific book. He began his studies of numerical cognition with Jacques Mehler, examining the cross-linguistic frequency of number words,[6] whether numbers were understood in an analog or compositional manner,[7][8] and the connection between numbers and space (the \"SNARC effect\").[9] With Changeux, he then developed a computational model of numerical abilities, which predicted log-gaussian tuning functions for number neurons,[10] a finding which has now been elegantly confirmed with single-unit physiology[11] With long-time collaborator Laurent Cohen, a neurologist at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, Dehaene also identified patients with lesions in different regions of the parietal lobe with impaired multiplication, but preserved subtraction (associated with lesions of the inferior parietal lobule) and others with impaired subtraction, but preserved multiplication (associated with lesions to the intraparietal sulcus).[12] This double dissociation suggested that different neural subtrates for overlearned, linguistically mediated calculations, like multiplication, are mediated by inferior parietal regions, while on-line computations, like subtraction are mediated by the intraparietal sulcus. Shortly thereafter, Dehaene began EEG[13][14] and functional neuroimaging[15][16][17] studies of these capacities, showing that parietal and frontal regions were specifically involved in mathematical cognition, including the dissociation between subtraction and multiplication observed in his previous patient studies. Together with Pierre Pica, and Elizabeth Spelke, Stanislas Dehaene has studied the numeracy and numeral expressions of the mundurucu (an indigenous tribe living in Para, Brazil).",

Gunn's early theoretical work in astronomy has helped establish the current understanding of how galaxies form, and the properties of the space between galaxies. He also suggested important observational tests to confirm the presence of dark matter in galaxies, and predicted the existence of a Gunn–Peterson trough in the spectra of distant quasars.\n\nMuch of Gunn's later work has involved leadership in major observational projects. He developed plans for one of the first uses of digital camera technology for space observation, a project that led to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the most extensive three-dimensional mapping of the universe ever undertaken. He also played a major role with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera on the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nGunn earned his bachelor's degree at Rice University in Houston, Texas, in 1961, and his Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1966.

In 1991, Dr. Croce was named Director of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Jefferson Medical College at the Thomas Jefferson University, in Philadelphia. While at Jefferson, he discovered the role of microRNAs in cancer pathogenesis and progression, implicating a new class of genes in cancer causation. In 2004 he moved to The Ohio State University. Under his direction at Ohio State faculty within the Human Cancer Genetics Program conduct both clinical and basic research. Basic research projects focus on how genes are activated and inactivated, how cell-growth signals are transmitted and regulated within cells, and how cells interact with the immune system.

Fundamental to this work has been the development of methods to measure dietary intake in large populations. Thus we have devoted substantial ongoing effort to the creation and refinement of standardized dietary questionnaires that can be completed repeatedly by subjects over a number of years. Such questionnaires have now been demonstrated to provide reasonably accurate assessments of a wide spectrum of dietary factors. In addition, we continue to work on the development and evaluation of biological markers of dietary intake, particularly using plasma and toenail samples. These biological indicators are primarily utilized in nested case-control studies using the large specimen banks collected prospectively as part of our ongoing studies.Education\n\nM.D., 1970, University of Michigan Medical School\nM.P.H. 1973, Harvard School of Public Health\nDr.P.H., 1980, Harvard School of Public Health, Epidemiology\nChair, 1991, Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health",

While in Boston, he and his colleague Jeffrey Gulcher decided to return to Iceland to perform genetic studies to determine multiple sclerosis risk.\nKári Stefánsson founded DeCode Genetics in 1996 in the midst of concerns about privacy related to a large centralized healthcare database and the commercial use of health information and genetics. As of 2003, nearly 100,000 of 285,000 Icelandic citizens have consented and given blood to DeCode Genetics for analysis.[3] The process has linked the country’s genetics profiles with medical records and genealogy information. This has led to the discovery of the neuregulin-1 gene's association with schizophrenia, a condition that Stefánsson’s brother has.[4] In 2007, his compensation was $662,296.[5] He was on the Time 100 list in 2007.\n\nAlthough the company was bankrupt in 2009, it resumed its data collection in 2014 after it was purchased by Amgen, by sending out another 100,000 envelopes to add to the 120,000 samples already taken.[6]\n\nA website named after the Icelandic history Íslendingabók has made it possible for Icelanders to see a relatively complete genealogy of all Icelanders.

Decision Research is a collection of scientists from all over the nation and in other countries that study decision-making in times when risks are involved. He was also the president for the Society of Risk Analysis until 1984. He earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford University in 1959 and his Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Michigan in 1964 and has received honorary doctorates from the Stockholm School of Economics and the University of East Anglia.[1] He is past president of the Society for Risk Analysis and in 1991 received its Distinguished Contribution Award. In 1993, he received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association, and in 1995 he received the Outstanding Contribution to Science Award from the Oregon Academy of Science.\n\nDr. Slovic studies human judgment, decision making, and risk perception, and has published extensively on these topics. He is considered, with Baruch Fischhoff, a leading theorist and researcher in the risk perception field (the psychometric paradigm,[2] the affect heuristic, and \"risk as feeling\"[3]).\n\nHis most recent work examines “psychic numbing”[4] and the failure to respond to mass human tragedies.\nMajor Theories：\nAffect Heuristic - This is the ability to make a quick emotional decision in time of crisis. Slovic says that even if there is a bad situation, if we have positive feelings toward something it lowers people’s perception of risks but enhances their perception of benefits.[6]\n\nSlovic contributed towards the psychometric paradigm of risk perception. He found that people usually perceived most activities as having a high risk. He also found that if someone gained pleasure from something they saw the risk level being low. This shows that risk levels can depend on the individual’s personal belief and emotions of a specific risk.[7]\n\nPsychophysical Numbing - This is the idea that people are not as affected by the loss of life depending on how it is presented. Slovic says that people cannot connect on an emotional level when being presented with large numbers.",

            "bio": "Hans Lehrach studied Chemistry at the University of Vienna and obtained his Ph.D. at the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine and the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in 1974. As postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, Cambridge (1974-1978) his research focused on RNA analysis and he carried out one of the first cDNA cloning experiments. As group leader at the EMBL, Heidelberg (1978-1987), he was among the first who initiated positional cloning experiments in mouse (Brachyury) and man (Huntington’s disease, Cystic Fibrosis etc), he also contributed to the development of widely used research tools (e.g. the EMBL vector system together with Noreen Murray) and was one of the first who initiated the human genome project. Following this, he moved to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London (1987-1994) as head of Genome Analysis Department, focusing on the development of new structural and functional genome analysis technologies (e.g. development of the first array robotics in 1987). In 1994, he returned to Germany and since then he has been Director and Scientific Member at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, with a focus on genetics, genomics and systems biology.\n\nHis scientific achievements are numerous, among those are the early contribution to the cloning of collagen cDNA, early positional cloning work (Chorea Huntington gene etc.), key work on technologies such as protein microarrays, protein interactome analysis, yeast artificial chromosomes and RNAseq, as well as the involvement in several genome sequencing projects, such as the human, rat, and Schizosaccharomyces Pombe. During the last decade, a major focus of his work has been the development of a new, truly personalised medicine on the basis of ‘virtual patient’ models, based on a deep –omics analysis of the patient. He has received several awards such as the Ján Jessenius SAS Medal of Honour for outstanding achievements in medical sciences of the Slovak Academy of Sciences (2003) and the Karl Heinz Beckurts Award for achievements in genome research (2004).\n\nHans Lehrach has co-founded several biotechnology companies such as Sequana Therapeutics, GPC Biotech, Scienion, Prot@gen, PSF Biotech, Atlas Biolabs, Alacris Theranostics, as well as the Dahlem Centre for Genome Research and Medical Systems Biology gGmbH (DCGMS).",

These two disorders frequently occur together and cause numerous problems for patients and their families.  We need new medicines for these disorders because the ones we use now are only partially effective or cannot be used widely because they cause other problems.  Importantly, no medicines can currently cure or prevent these disorders.  The Faraone Lab searches for genes that cause ADHD and autism and figures out how these genes differ from genes in other children.  We then study how these genes work together with networks of other genes in brain cells.  By learning how defects in risk genes for ADHD and autism disturb the functioning of these networks, we find new targets for medicines.",

Johnson is a Professor of Computer Science and in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University, and is a member of the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology at Rice. Prior to joining the faculty at Rice in 2000, he was an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where he had been a member of the faculty for eight years. He received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science in 1990, the M.S. degree in Computer Science in 1985, and the B.A. degree with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences in 1982, all from Rice University. After completing his Ph.D., he also served for two years as a Research Scientist and Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Rice. His research interests are generally in the areas of network protocols, distributed systems, and operating systems, particularly in the interactions between these areas.\n\nProfessor Johnson founded and is leading the Monarch (MObile Networking ARCHitectures) research group at Rice (previously at Carnegie Mellon University), developing adaptive networking protocols and architectures to allow truly seamless wireless and mobile networking. He has worked substantially on the problems of Mobile IP and different types of multihop wireless networking including mobile ad hoc networking, sensor networking, and mesh networking. Related to this research, he has also been very active since 1993 in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the principal protocol standards development body for the Internet, primarily in the Mobile IP and Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) working groups. He was one of the main designers of the IETF Mobile IP protocol for IPv4, the current version of IP in use in the Internet today, and is the primary designer of Mobile IP for IPv6, the new version of IP replacing IPv4. His group's Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) for ad hoc networks has also been published by the IETF as an Experimental protocol for the Internet.\n\nFrom 2005 through 2009, Professor Johnson served as the Chair of ACM SIGMOBILE, the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Mobility of Systems, Users, Data, and Computing; and was previously Treasurer of SIGMOBILE for seven years. He is also currently serving as a member of the ACM SIG Governing Board Executive Committee (SGB EC). He was General Chair for MobiCom 2003 and VANET 2006, and was Technical Program Chair for VANET 2005, MobiHoc 2002, and MobiCom 1997. He has been a member of the Technical Program Committee for over 40 international conferences and workshops, and has been an editor for the journals Ad Hoc Networks, IEEE Pervasive Computing (Founding Editorial Board Member), IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, Wireless Networks, Mobile Networks and Applications, and Mobile Computing and Communications Review.

            "bio": "John Michael Wallace (born October 28, 1940), is a professor of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington, as well as the former director of the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO)—a joint research venture between the University of Washington and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). His research concerns understanding global climate and its variations using observations and covers the quasi biennial oscillation, Pacific decadal oscillation and the annular modes of the Arctic oscillation and the Antarctic oscillation, and the dominant spatial patterns in month-to-month and year-to-year climate variability, including the one through which El Niño phenomenon in the tropical Pacific influences climate over North America. He is also the coauthor with Peter V. Hobbs of what is generally considered the standard introductory textbook in the field: Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey. He was the third most cited geoscientist during the period 1973–2007.\nMy research and that of my students has been directed at improving our understanding of global climate and its year-to-year and decade-to-decade variations, making use of observational data. We have contributed to the identification and understanding of a number of atmospheric phenomena, including the vertically propagating planetary waves that drive the quasi-biennial oscillation in zonal winds in the equatorial stratosphere, the 4-5-day period easterly waves that modulate daily rainfall over the tropical oceans, and the dominant spatial patterns in month-to-month and year-to-year climate variability, including the one through which the El Nio phenomenon in the tropical Pacific influences climate over North America. We have contributed to documenting the existence of El Nino- like variability on a decade to decade time scale (the so called 'Pacific Decadal Oscillation'). We are currently investigating two analogous patterns of weather and climate variability: the Northern and Southern Hemisphere 'annular modes' which have played a prominent role in the climatic trends of the past 30 years.",

I serve as Principal Investigator of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 nurses followed since 1976. I served as a founding co-investigator and remain active in three other cohorts: Nurses' Health Study II, a cohort of 116,680 nurses followed since 1989, the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, a cohort of 51,000 men begun in 1986, and the Physicians' Health Study of 22,071 men followed since 1982. Biologic samples have been collected in each of the cohorts, sometimes repeatedly. Using a nested case-control design, the samples are analyzed for a variety of markers of cancer (and other outcomes). We examine a wide range of topics in these studies, but a major focus is on nutrition. We use food frequency questionnaires, diet records, anthropometry, and biochemical analyses of serum, plasma, DNA, RNA, red cells, adipose tissue, tumor tissue, and toenails. These studies investigate many health outcomes including cancer, and precursors such as polyps, benign breast disease, and obesity. We are also initiating studies in cancer survivorship, including quality of life.\n\nThe major focus of my research is in prostate cancer, for etiology, diagnosis, prognosis and secondary prevention. I have a particular interest in pathoepidemiology, gene expression and prostate cancer risk and prognosis. \n\nMost of my teaching is at the Harvard School of Public Health, where I teach the Practice of Epidemiology.

After discovering how environmental stress caused by either infection, inflammation or exposure to toxic substances leads to activation of AP-1, NF-κB and other transcription factors, his lab began to examine the role of the key signaling pathways controlling these transcription factors in the pathogenesis of cancer, degenerative and metabolic diseases. The Karin group has identified some of the fundamental mechanisms through which inflammation and obesity promote tumor development and progression and contribute to type II diabetes. They had established the mechanisms through which members of the IL-6 cytokine family contribute to the development of colorectal and liver cancer through activation of STAT3 and other transcription factors. They had also established the complex and cell type specific mechanisms through which NF-κB activation via IκB kinases (IKK) controls development and progression of colon, liver and prostate cancers. They were amongst the first to demonstrate that not only innate immune cells, such as macrophages, but also adaptive immune cells, including T regulatory cells and B lymphocytes, also contribute to tumorigenesis and its progression.

He is a leading world authority on signal transduction pathways that regulate gene expression in response to extracellular stimuli, infection, inflammation and stress. Key achievements include the definition of cis elements that mediate gene induction by hormones, cytokines and stress, identification and characterization of the transcription factors that recognize these elements (members of the AP-1/ATF family) and the protein kinase cascades that regulate their activities, including the Jun kinases (JNK) and IkB kinases (IKK). Much of Dr. Karin’s current activity is focused on understanding the link between inflammation, cancer and metabolic disease as well as on understanding the signaling mechanisms used by receptors involved in inflammation and innate immunity. In addition to establishing molecular links between obesity, inflammation and cancer, this work has revealed new targets for cancer prevention and therapy.

            "bio": "Paul is the Development Manager for Whole Page Relevance (WPR) at Bing.  His team provides the glue between the frontend “UX” and backend “web relevance”.  Among other features, the WPR team provides query suggestions, determines how results are arranged on the page, and measures overall user satisfaction.\n\n \n\nPaul came to Microsoft as a Researcher in 2002.  Before moving to Search, Paul and his team worked on numerous efforts to use machine learning in the analysis of documents, emails, and web pages.  Results of this work can be seen in products like Windows, Live Search, and Microsoft Dynamics.  In collaboration with the Live Toolbar team we built the technology behind “smart menus”.  The Tablet PC team uses our technology to extract the structure in handwritten ink notes.  East Asian Office is using his technology to extract contact information from incoming emails.  Dynamics/CRM is using his technology to automatically route and analyze incoming faxes.   Live Search uses similar technology to classify and extract information from documents and queries.\n\n \n\nPaul has served on the program committees of conferences such as Neural Information Process Systems (NIPS), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), and the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).  He has received the Marr Prize for the best paper in computer vision (at ICCV 2003).  An earlier paper on medical image processing received an honorable mention for the Marr prize in 1995.  He received an honorable mention for best paper at AAAI 2004. While at MIT he received the NSF Career award as one of the top junior faculty members in Computer Science.\n\n \n\nPaul’s interest in intelligent systems goes back quite a ways.  As an IBM intern in 1986, Paul Viola constructed a semi-autonomous robotic wheel chair called “Mr. Ed”.  This ride-on robot incorporated sensors and a microprocessor,  and required no more than coarse and infrequent feedback to navigate a hallway,  or go through a doorway.  Until 1990,  he studied robotics with Rod Brooks at MIT.  There he received a master’s degree for the construction of an autonomous visual robot patterned on the simple mammalian oculomotor processes.  After brief forays into neuroscience and structural molecular biology (at Arris Phamaceutical now Axys), Paul returned to MIT to complete his Ph.D. on biomedical image processing.\n\n \n\nPaul’s thesis work on the registration of images from various medical sensors has been widely used and reimplemented (his thesis has been referenced more than 800 times).  It is now a standard technique that appears in many commercial products,  and is widely considered the best and most reliable registration technique for assistance in surgical planning.  \n\n \n\nIn 1995, Dr. Viola returned to MIT as an assistant professor and later an associate professor.  His work focused on statistical learning for image processing and computer vision.   In the area of computer graphics his work with Jeremy De Bonet is considered the first effective texture synthesis algorithm for complex textural patterns.  Other work included techniques for image database retrieval and 3D reconstruction.\n\n \n\nWhile visiting Compaq Cambridge research labs in 2000,  he created the world’s first real-time face detection system.  This system has been widely adopted and reimplemented: Intel distributes this algorithm in a computer vision toolkit;  MSRA has adopted and improved the algorithm.  Though it was developed outside of MS, it is actually in wide use inside of MSR (as well as many other companies and universities).  After leaving MIT to join the Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, he worked on face recognition, surveillance, and real-time computer vision.\n",

Clarke received a B.A. degree in mathematics from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, in 1967, an M.A. degree in mathematics from Duke University, Durham NC, in 1968, and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Cornell University, Ithaca NY, in 1976. After receiving his Ph.D., he taught in the Department of Computer Science, Duke University, for two years. In 1978 he moved to Harvard University, Cambridge, MA where he was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the Division of Applied Sciences. He left Harvard in 1982 to join the faculty in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. He was appointed Full Professor in 1989. In 1995 he became the first recipient of the FORE Systems Professorship, an endowed chair in the School of Computer Science. He was named a University Professor in 2008\n\nDr. Clarke's interests include software and hardware verification and automatic theorem proving. In his Ph.D. thesis he proved that certain programming language control structures did not have good Hoare style proof systems. In 1981 he and his Ph.D. student Allen Emerson first proposed the use of Model Checking as a verification technique for finite state concurrent systems. His research group pioneered the use of Model Checking for hardware verification. Symbolic Model Checking using BDDs was also developed by his group. This important technique was the subject of Kenneth McMillan's Ph.D. thesis, which received an ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award. In addition, his resarch group developed the first parallel resolution theorem prover (Parthenon) and the first theorem prover to be based on a symbolic computation system (Analytica).\n\nDr. Clarke has served on the editorial boards of Distributed Computing, Logic and Computation, and IEEE Transactions in Software Engineering. He is the former editor-in-chief of Formal Methods in Systems Design. He is on the organizing committee of Logic in Computer Science (LICS) and on the steering committee of  Computer-Aided Verification (CAV). He received a Technical Excellence Award with Randy Bryant and Ken McMillan from the Semiconductor Research Corporation in 1995 for his work on formal verification techniques. He was a co-winner with Randy Bryant, Allen Emerson, and Kenneth McMillan of the ACM Kanellakis Award in 1998 for the development of Symbolic Model Checking.  In 1999 he received an Allen Newell Award for Excellence in Research from the Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Department.  In 2004 he received the IEEE Harry H. Goode Memorial Award for significant and pioneering contributions to formal verification of hardware and software systems, and for the profound impact these contributions have had on the electronics industry.  He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2005 for contributions to the formal verification of hardware and software correctness.  He was a recipient with Allen Emerson and Joseph Sifakis of the 2007 ACM Turing AwardModel Checking into a highly effective verification technology, widely adopted in the hardware and software industries.  In 2008 he received the CADE Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Reasoning in recognition of his role in the invention of Model Checking and his sustained leadership in the area for more than two decades.

Over a period of nearly 40 years he made many fundamental and pioneering contributions to nearly every area of that field. He wrote the first textbook in the field (1969); was founding editor of its first journal (1972); and was co-chairman of its first international conference (1987).

My group is engaged in research efforts to develop management and scheduling techniques that empower high throughput computing on local and wide area clusters of distributively owned resources. The results of these efforts are translated into production code and are incorporated into the Condor system. Condor is a widely used high throughput computing system. The worldwide user community of Condor plays an important and active role in our research. Researchers from a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines collaborate with us in the development and evaluation of Condor.\nIn the area of visual exploration of information my group works on developing a framework and tools for intuitive graphical interaction with collections of multimedia data. Our framework is based on a declarative approach to the creation of active visual presentations of tabular data. We implement our tools in Java and work closely with domain scientists on testing and evaluating them with real data. Some of this data is stored in scientific databases that are connected to real-time and off-line data sources.",

He began his academic career that same year as Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of Missouri. In 1981 he was promoted to Associate Professor, and in 1985 he was named the Frederick A. Middlebush Professor of Psychology at Missouri. After a sabbatical at Yale University in 1986, he returned to Ohio State in 1987 as Professor of Psychology and Director of the Social Psychology Doctoral Program. In 1995, he was visiting Professor of Psychology at Princeton University. In 1998, he was appointed Distinguished University Professor at Ohio State. He served as chair of the psychology department from 1998-2002 and again from 2008-present.\n\nPetty's research focuses broadly on the situational and individual difference factors responsible for changes in beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Much of his current work (and that of the students and colleagues with whom he collaborates) is aimed at examining the implications of the Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion for understanding prejudice, consumer choices, political and legal decisions, and health behaviors. Topics of special current interest include: understanding the role of meta-cognitive as well as implicit factors in persuasion and resistance to change; the effect of racial and ethnic prejudice and specific emotions on social judgment and behavior; and investigating how people correct their evaluations for various factors they think may have biased their judgments (such as stereotypes they hold or emotions they are experiencing). \n\nIn addition to his empirical work on basic processes in attitudes, persuasion, and social cognition, Petty has served as a consultant and panelist for federal agencies such as the National Academy of Sciences Committees on Dietary Guidelines Implementation to Improve the Health of Americans and a Social Psychology of Aging, the National Institute on Drug Abuse panel on Using Persuasive Communication to Prevent Drug Abuse, and the National Science Foundation panel on the Human Dimensions of Global Change. He is also former chair of the National Institute of Mental Health grant review panel on Social and Group Processes. \n\nAmong the honors and awards he has received are the following: In 1995, Petty received the Distinguished Scholar Award from Ohio State University. In 1999, he was named Distinguished Scientist-Lecturer for the American Psychological Association. In 2000, he received the award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Consumer Psychology from the Society for Consumer Psychology, and in 2001 he received the Donald T. Campbell Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Social Psychology from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. Petty is a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychological Society. After serving as Associate Editor of the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin from 1982-1984, he became the journal's editor from 1988-1991. He has also served as Associate Editor for the APA journal, Emotion, and on the editorial boards of Psychological Review, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, the Personality and Social Psychology Review, the Journal of Consumer Research, the Journal of Consumer Psychology, the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, and Media Psychology.

After a successful PhD under the supervision of Alan E. \nSmith at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories (now called the \nLondon Research Institute), he moved to the laboratory of G. Steven Martin \nat the University of California, Berkeley. His postdoctoral experience \nnurtured a longstanding interest in the molecular mechanisms of cellular \ntransformation and cancer progression. He continued this work when \nhe took up a faculty position in the Department of \nMicrobiology at the University of British Columbia, \nVancouver, in 1981. In 1985, Tony was recruited \nto the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute at the \nMount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, and was director of \nthe institute from 2002 to 2005. He was also a senior \nfellow of Massey College at the University of Toronto. \nTony was a passionate supporter of colleagues and \ntrainees and an eloquent advocate for Canadian \nscience. He was hugely influential within the \ninternational cell-signaling community and attracted \nmany recognized leaders of this field to the University \nof Toronto and its affiliated research institutes.\nTony’s principal discovery was the Src homology 2 \n(SH2) domain, a noncatalytic segment of protein that \nfolds to form a phosphotyrosine-recognition motif. This provided a simple \nand elegant means to recruit SH2 domain–containing proteins to sites of \ntyrosine phosphorylation. In a seminal paper (Sadowski, I., Stone, J.C. \nand Pawson, T., Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 4396–4408, 1986), Pawson and \ncolleagues showed that the SH2 domain modifies kinase function and \nthe transforming activity of Fujinami sarcoma virus. Soon afterwards, they \nand others showed that many oncogenic tyrosine kinases, scaffolding and \nadaptor proteins contain SH2 domains. This early work culminated in the \nstructural elucidation of SH2 domains, detailed mutagenic investigation \nof this common polypeptide fold and the realization that phosphotyrosine \nsignaling proceeds through ‘protein-interaction modules’ to facilitate the \nassembly of macromolecular complexes. These findings not only provided \nthe context for the initial discovery of phosphotyrosine by Tony Hunter \nbut also offered a first glimpse of a molecular language that cells use to \nrelay intracellular signals.\nEmboldened by his early discoveries, Tony embarked on a systematic \nanalysis of protein-interaction modules.

He was also a senior \nfellow of Massey College at the University of Toronto. \nTony was a passionate supporter of colleagues and \ntrainees and an eloquent advocate for Canadian \nscience. He was hugely influential within the \ninternational cell-signaling community and attracted \nmany recognized leaders of this field to the University \nof Toronto and its affiliated research institutes.\nTony’s principal discovery was the Src homology 2 \n(SH2) domain, a noncatalytic segment of protein that \nfolds to form a phosphotyrosine-recognition motif. This provided a simple \nand elegant means to recruit SH2 domain–containing proteins to sites of \ntyrosine phosphorylation. In a seminal paper (Sadowski, I., Stone, J.C. \nand Pawson, T., Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 4396–4408, 1986), Pawson and \ncolleagues showed that the SH2 domain modifies kinase function and \nthe transforming activity of Fujinami sarcoma virus. Soon afterwards, they \nand others showed that many oncogenic tyrosine kinases, scaffolding and \nadaptor proteins contain SH2 domains. This early work culminated in the \nstructural elucidation of SH2 domains, detailed mutagenic investigation \nof this common polypeptide fold and the realization that phosphotyrosine \nsignaling proceeds through ‘protein-interaction modules’ to facilitate the \nassembly of macromolecular complexes. These findings not only provided \nthe context for the initial discovery of phosphotyrosine by Tony Hunter \nbut also offered a first glimpse of a molecular language that cells use to \nrelay intracellular signals.\nEmboldened by his early discoveries, Tony embarked on a systematic \nanalysis of protein-interaction modules. He published a series of influential papers that charted the identification, structure and function \nof several modular domains. These works were augmented by proteome-wide analysis of interaction networks and the development of genetically \nmodified–mouse models to test the physiological role of modular \nscaffolding and adaptor proteins. Tony’s boundless curiosity also led him \ninto the burgeoning field of bioinformatics. He was a proponent for the \nuse of algorithms to catalog modular protein-interaction domains, and he \nhelped develop a procedure called protein domain profiling, which orders \nproteins in the entire proteome by hierarchical clustering based on domain \ncomposition and linkage. There are now about 90 defined distinct proteininteraction modules. His collective work of over 400 articles illustrates how \nsignaling through protein-interaction modules provides precise spatial \nand temporal control of the cell.",

            "bio": "Detlef Weigel (born 1961 in Lower Saxony, Germany) is a German American scientist working at the interface of developmental and evolutionary biology.\nWeigel was an undergraduate in biology and chemistry at the universities of Bielefeld and Cologne. In 1986, he graduated with a Diploma in biology for this thesis on Drosophila neurogenesis with the late José Campos-Ortega. In 1988, he moved to the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen. During his PhD work with Herbert Jäckle, he discovered the founding member of an important class of transcription factors, the Forkhead/FOX proteins.[1][2] In 1988, he graduated with a PhD (summa cum laude) from the Eberhard-Karls-Universität.\n\nWeigel began to work with plants during his postdoctoral research with Elliot M. Meyerowitz at Caltech, where he cloned the floral regulator LEAFY from Arabidopsis thaliana.[3] From 1993 to 2002, he was an Assistant and then Associate Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla. In 2002, he accepted an appointment as Scientific Member and Director at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, where he founded the Department for Molecular Biology. He is also an Adjunct Professor at the Salk Institute and the University of Tübingen.\nDuring the 1990s, Weigel mostly studied the development of individual flowers and how the onset of flowering is regulated. His group made important discoveries in both areas. Together with Ove Nilsson, he demonstrated that transfer of the LEAFY gene from Arabidopsis thaliana to aspen trees was sufficient to reduce the time to flowering from years to months.[4] Weigel and his team isolated the FT gene,[5] which was later found to be an important component of the mobile signal inducing flowering.[6] New genetic tools developed by his group led to the discovery of the first microRNA mutant in plants.[7]\n\nThrough his study of factors that control the onset of flowering, a quintessential adaptive trait, Weigel became interested in more general questions of evolution. Apart from work on genetic variation in environment-dependent developmental processes, his group is known for the generation of extensive genomic resources, such as the first haplotype map for a non-mammalian species.[8][9] To further exploit and advance the understanding of genetic variation, Weigel and colleagues initiated the 1001 Genomes project for Arabidopsis thaliana. Related to this is a new area of interest, in reproductive isolation. In collaboration with Jeffery Dangl, his group discovered that genetic barriers in plants are often associated with autoimmunity. In work led by former postdoc Kirsten Bomblies, now an Assistant Professor at Harvard, they could show that in certain hybrid offspring, specific gene products contributed by one of the parents may be inappropriately recognized as foreign and pathogenic, and thus trigger pervasive cell death throughout the plant.",

Memberships： National Academy of Sciences； Institute of Medicine； American Academy of Arts and Sciences； Association of American Physicians； American Academy of Microbiology。\nOur laboratory investigates 1) the molecular events underlying T-lymphocyte differentiation and activation and 2) how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enters target cells and causes systemic depletion of helper T cells. In both areas, we study the functions of T-cell surface molecules and their interactions with intracellular signal transducing components.\nDuring development, CD4 and CD8 glycoproteins are co-expressed on immature thymocytes (double-positive cells), which are then selected according to their ability to interact productively with host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on thymic epithelium. Cells with T-cell receptors specific for MHC class I shut off CD4 and commit to becoming cytotoxic cells, while cells with T-cell receptors for MHC class II shut off CD8 and become helper cells. We use gene targeting and transgenic technology in mice to study how the double-positive cells commit to either of the two major T-lymphocyte lineages.\n\nIn our studies with immunodeficiency viruses, we seek to understand how the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with CD4 and various chemokine receptors on the target cells results in membrane fusion and viral entry. We are also developing mouse model systems to determine how HIV infection causes loss of CD4+ helper T cells. In related studies, the functions of chemokine receptors in development and in inflammatory responses are being investigated.",

            "bio": "Antoine Bechara is a Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Southern California. His research marks three key accomplishments that resulted in a significant influence on the field. The first is his development of what became known as the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). This work began in Iowa with Antonio R. and Hanna Damasio using the brain lesion method to study the decision-making capabilities of patients who have suffered injury to the ventromedial sector of their prefrontal cortex. At the time, the decision-making deficit seen in these patients presented a puzzling defect because their impairment was so obvious in their real life, but there was no clinical test that detects and measure this decision-making impairment. Many of these challenges were overcome after his development of the IGT. His work has certainly drawn attention to the potential value in studying the neural basis of decision-making, and in bringing this question to the laboratory through the use of structured decision-making tasks involving choices that mimic real-life situations, in the way they factor uncertainty, reward, and punishment (e.g., see Bechara et al., Cognition, 2004; Bechara and Damasio, Games and Economic Behavior, 2005). The second is his application of the work on decision-making from neurological patients to understanding the mechanisms of decision-making in certain psychiatric disorders, namely addiction. He was among the first who argued that addiction is also a disorder of impaired decision-making (impaired prefrontal cortex), and not just a disorder of abnormal mesolimbic dopamine, as it was the predominant view at the time (e.g., see Bechara, Nature Neuroscience, 2005). The third is his finding that the insula is critical for smoking addiction (and potentially other substances of abuse). This finding brought to light the potential role of a new neural region, which was completely ignored in the past, in the psychopathology of addiction (e.g., see Naqvi et al., Science, 2007). Thus his research helped lead the way of integrating decision neuroscience with research in two key areas: one is mental health, and this includes substance addiction, but it also extends to several other psychopathologies such as bipolar and impulse control disorders (e.g., see Yechiam et al., Psychological Science, 2005); the other is the social sciences where his work helped contribute to the strengthening of the integration between the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and social sciences, including economics, marketing, and consumer behavior. Indeed some of these areas in the social sciences became very interested in understanding the brain mechanisms that underlie human choice, and why do people choose the way they do in social contexts such as financial investment (e.g., see Shiv et al., Psychological Science, 2005).",

            "bio": "My research program has three main aspects. The first and central component is work on the development and testing through computer simulation of methods for the analysis of DNA sequence data. We have developed methods for estimating gene genealogies, detecting recombination, detecting selection, and measuring genetic diversity and demographic events in the history of a population. We develop software to implement many of these methods and then develop software to test our methods and many others by comparison through computer simulation. Through comparison and tests of robustness to assumption violations, we can gain great insights into why particular methods perform well or poorly and then are in a good position to redevelop improved methodology. In fact, we are currently embarking on the development of a comprehensive simulation software package that allows one, for the first time, to examine the impact of a host of population genetic phenomena at the same time (e.g., migration, mutation, recombination, selection, fluctuating population sizes, tracking geographic locations of alleles in a population, multiple locus populations, etc.). Through such studies, we gain a better understanding of the methodology we use to infer evolutionary and population demographic histories and associated parameter estimates when we apply them to empirical data. Furthermore, such studies provide valuable insights into the development of new and improved theory and methodology for inference from DNA sequence data.",

            "bio": "Martin A. Nowak is Professor of Biology and Mathematics at Harvard University and Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. He works on the mathematical description of evolutionary processes, including the evolution of cooperation and human language, as well as the dynamics of virus infections and human cancer. His major scientific contributions and discoveries include: the mechanism of HIV disease progression; the rapid turnover and evolution of drug resistance in HIV infection; quantifying the dynamics of HBV infection; the evolution of virulence under superinfection and coinfection; the role of chromosomal instability in human cancer; quantifying the dynamics of chronic myeloid leukemia; the accumulation of drivers and passengers in cancer progression; the evolution of drug resistance in targeted cancer therapy; the mechanisms for the evolution of genetic redundancy; \"generous tit-for-tat\" and \"win-stay, lose-shift\"; the alternating Prisoner's Dilemma; the evolution of cooperation by indirect reciprocity; spatial game dynamics; adaptive dynamics; evolutionary game dynamics in finite populations; evolutionary graph theory; the five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation; the evolution of eusociality by natural selection; a mathematical approach for studying the evolution of human language; the dynamics of language regularization; culturomics; \"winners don't punish\"; prelife; and the origin of evolution.\n\nAn Austrian by birth, he studied biochemistry and mathematics at the University of Vienna with Peter Schuster and Karl Sigmund. He received his Ph.D. sub auspiciis praesidentis in 1989. He went on to the University of Oxford as an Erwin Schrödinger Scholar and worked there with Robert May, the later Lord May of Oxford, with whom he co-authored numerous articles and his first book, Virus Dynamics (2000). Nowak was a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College and later at Keble College. He was also a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow. Nowak became head of the mathematical biology group at Oxford in 1995 and Professor of Mathematical Biology in 1997. A year later, he moved to Princeton to establish the first program in theoretical biology at the Institute for Advanced Study. He accepted his present position at Harvard University in 2003.\n\nA corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Nowak is the recipient of numerous prizes, including the Weldon Memorial Prize of Oxford University, the David Starr Jordan Prize of Stanford University, and the Akira Okubo Prize of the Society for Mathematical Biology. Nowak is the author of over 350 papers and four books. Evolutionary Dynamics (2006) provides an overview of the powerful yet simple laws that govern the evolution of living systems. SuperCooperators (2011) argues that cooperation is the third fundamental principle of evolution beside mutation and selection.",

She has conducted extensive research on the malleability of human memory. Loftus is best known for her ground-breaking work on the misinformation effect and eyewitness memory,[5] and the creation and nature of false memories,[6] including recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse.[7] As well as her prolific work inside the laboratory, Loftus has been heavily involved in applying her research to legal settings; she has consulted or provided expert witness testimony for hundreds of cases.[7][8] Loftus has been recognized throughout the world for her work, receiving numerous awards and honorary degrees. In 2002, Loftus was ranked 58th in the Review of General Psychology’s list of the 100 most influential psychological researchers of the 20th century, and was the highest ranked woman on the list.\nLoftus received her Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and psychology with highest honors from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1966. She received her MA in 1967 and Ph.D in 1970 (both in mathematical psychology and both from Stanford University), the only woman in her cohort.[3] Her thesis was entitled \"An Analysis of the Structural Variables That Determine Problem-Solving Difficulty on a Computer-Based Teletype.\"[13] Loftus took her first academic appointment in 1970 at the New School for Social Research in New York City.[3] Her research during her time there focused on the organization of semantic information in longterm memory.[3] However Loftus soon realized she wanted to do research with greater social relevance.[13] Loftus attributes this realization in part to a conversation with an acquaintance to whom she was describing her findings about semantic memory, who wondered at the cost of the research compared to its value.In 1973 Loftus accepted an assistant professorship at the University of Washington and used the new position to begin a new line of research into how memory works in real-world settings,[3][7][10] beginning the empirical study of eyewitness testimony.[8] One of the first studies she conducted was the reconstruction of automobile destruction study,[10] in which she found that the way in which questions were worded altered the memories subjects reported.[5][10] Loftus’ next step was to investigate whether asking leading questions, or providing misleading information in other forms, might also affect people’s memory for the original event.[5] To answer this question she developed the misinformation effect paradigm, which demonstrated that the memories of eyewitnesses are altered after being exposed to incorrect information about an event and that memory is highly malleable and open to suggestion.[5][8][11] The misinformation effect became one of the most influential and widely known effects in psychology,[5] and Loftus’ early work on the effect generated hundreds of follow-up studies examining factors that improve or worsen the accuracy of memories, and to explored the cognitive mechanisms underlying the effect.",

Quasars and AGNs are galaxies in which new material is currently falling into supermassive black holes at their centers. He is particularly interested in understanding the accretion disks that feed these massive black holes, how mass and energy ejected from these black holes influences the evolution of galaxies over time, and how large quasar samples can be used as statistical probes of the structure of the Universe.\n\nRichards frequently uses both space-based observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, and Chandra X-ray Observatory in addition to ground-based observatories such at the 4-m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Very Large Array radio telescope.

I have worked on a number of issues in early vision, including image restoration, visual correspondence, and motion-based tracking. My recent work with Y. Boykov and O. Veksler provides novel algorithms for a fundamental class of vision problems whose previous solutions required exponential time. Our results rely on the application of recent results from graph theory, which can provide efficient algorithms that generate provably good answers. \n  \n\nI am also exploring a number of different applications of computer vision, with an emphasis on automating visual tasks. One of the most important applications is in the area of content-based access to image databases. While large collections of digital imagery are becoming commonplace, the tools available for accessing image databases are still quite primitive. My past work with G. Pass and with J. Huang et al. focused on this problem for collections of static images. In ongoing research, V. Kettnaker and I are addressing the issue for video, where we hope to exploit some insights about the role of contextual information in the human visual system. I am also working with Microsoft on automating some visual tasks that occur in the development of programs with graphical user interfaces. "

He invented statistical parametric mapping (SPM), voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and dynamic causal modelling (DCM). These contributions were motivated by schizophrenia research and theoretical studies of value-learning – formulated as the dysconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia. Mathematical contributions include variational Laplacian procedures and generalized filtering for hierarchical Bayesian model inversion. Friston currently works on models of functional integration in the human brain and the principles that underlie neuronal interactions. His main contribution to theoretical neurobiology is a free-energy principle for action and perception (active inference). Friston received the first Young Investigators Award in Human Brain Mapping (1996) and was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (1999). In 2000 he was President of the international Organization of Human Brain Mapping. In 2003 he was awarded the Minerva Golden Brain Award and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2006.

Over the years, this work has been done in close collaboration with Sergey Melnik (now at Google) and James Terwilliger (Microsoft), and with Suad Alagic (Univ. of Southern Maine), Alon Halevy (Google), Jayant Madhavan (Google), René Miller (Univ. of Toronto), Peter Mork (MITRE Corp.), Rachel Pottinger (Univ. of British Columbia), Christoph Quix (Technical Univ. of Aachen), Erhard Rahm (Univ. of Leipzig), Adi Unnithan (Microsoft), and many great interns.\n\nMy early research was primarily on transaction processing and, after a long hiatus, I resumed working in this area in 2006. I was a co-designer of the database engine for SQL Azure and of Hyder, a prototype transactional indexed-record manager that scales out without partitioning. I have also published the following two books on the subject.",

This laboratory was founded in 1990. On February 24 2010 he was appointed the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\nDr. Kikinis is the Principal Investigator of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC, a National Center for Biomedical Computing, an effort which is part of the NIH Roadmap Initiative), and of the Neuroimage Analysis Center (NAC a National Resource Center funded by NCRR). He is also the Research Director of the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), which is jointly sponsored by NCRR, NCI, and NIBIB and co-director of the IGT program at CIMIT.\nDuring the mid-80's, Dr. Kikinis developed a scientific interest in image processing algorithms and their use for extracting relevant information from medical imaging data. Since then, this topic has matured from a fairly exotic topic to a field of science. This is due to the explosive increase of both the quantity and complexity of imaging data. Dr. Kikinis has led and has participated in research in different areas of science. His activities include technological research (segmentation, registration, visualization, high performance computing), software system development (most recently the 3D Slicer software package), and biomedical research in a variety of biomedical specialties. The majority of his research is interdisciplinary in nature and is conducted by multidisciplinary teams. The results of this research have been reported in a variety of peer-reviewed journal articles. He is the author and co-author of more than 260 peer-reviewed articles.\nBefore joining Brigham & Women's Hospital in 1988, he trained as a resident in radiology at the University Hospital in Zurich, and as a researcher in computer vision at the ETH in Zurich, Switzerland. He received his M.D. degree from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, in 1982.",

Ioannidis grew up in Athens, Greece. He was Valedictorian (1984) at Athens College and won many early awards, including the National Award of the Greek Mathematical Society (1984). He graduated in the top rank of his medical school class from the University of Athens in 1990; also received a doctorate in biopathology from the same institution. He trained at Harvard and Tufts (internal medicine and infectious diseases), then held positions at NIH, Johns Hopkins and Tufts. He chaired the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology at the University of Ioannina Medical School in 1999-2010 (tenured professor since 2003). He has been adjunct faculty for Tufts University School of Medicine since 1996, with professor rank since 2002 and led (2008-2010) the Center for Genetic Epidemiology and Modeling. He has also been adjunct professor of epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health and visiting professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Imperial College. He is a member of the executive board of the Human Genome Epidemiology Network and Senior Advisor on Knowledge Integration at NIC, NIH and has served as President of the Society for Research Synthesis Methodology, as editorial board member of many leading international journals (including PLoS Medicine, Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine, JNCI, Science Translational Medicine, Clinical Chemistry, Molecular and Cellular Proteomics, AIDS, IJE, JCE, Clinical Trials, and PLoS ONE, among others) and as Editor-in-Chief of the European Journal of Clinical Investigation since 2010. He has given more than 350 invited and honorary lectures, has received many awards (e.g. European Award for Excellence in Clinical Science [2007], Medal for Distinguished Service, Teachers College, Columbia University [2015]), and has been inducted in the Association of American Physicians in 2009 and in the European Academy of Cancer Sciences in 2010. Honorary titles from the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH) (2014) and University of Ioannina (2015), honorary doctorate from Erasmus University Rotterdam (to be awarded 11/2015). The PLoS Medicine paper on “Why most Published Research Findings are False,” has been the most-accessed article in the history of Public Library of Science (exceeding 1.2 million hits). His books “Toccata for the Girl with the Burnt Face” (Kedros 2012) and “Variations on the Art of the Fugue and a Desparate Ricercar” (Kedros 2014) (both in Greek) were shortlisted for best book of the year Anagnostis awards. The Atlantic selected Ioannidis as the Brave Thinker scientist for 2010 claiming that he “may be one of the most influential scientists alive”. He is one of the most-cited scientists worldwide according to citation databases for which rankings are available (Web of Science/Highly-Cited Researchers, Scopus, Microsoft Academic Search). His current citation rate (>1,500 new citations per month per Google Scholar, >800 new citations per month per Scopus, >700 new citations per month per Web of Knowledge) places him in the 100 most-cited among all 20+ million authors publishing across science. Citation indices: h=126, m=6, hm=75 per Google Scholar (h=105 per ISI and Scopus), 68% of papers as single/first/senior author. He considers himself privileged to have learnt and to continue to learn from interactions with students and young scientists (of all ages) from all over the world and to be constantly reminded that he knows next to nothing.",

Before joining UCLA in 1997, I worked for about four and a half years at the Networked Computing Research Department at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ  (it was called  AT&T Bell Labs when I had joined, but perennial reorganizations had transformed it into Lucent Technologies - Bell Labs Innovations by the time I left!). My interests in mobile and wireless systems are largely because of my work at Bell Labs where my group built one of the first wireless ATM system. Prior to that, I did my graduate work in the EECS Department at Bob Brodersen in the general area of CAD tools for embedded DSP VLSI and system design. My M.S.  project (1988) was on CMOS bit-slice datapath compilation as part of the  Lager silicon compiler for DSP VLSI, while my Ph.D. dissertation (1992) was on hardware-software rapid prototyping and co-design at the board level for embedded DSP and control applications. Going even further back in time, I received my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT, Kanpur in India in 1985, and did my prior schooling at the Colvin Taluqdars' College in Lucknow, India - the city where I grew up.

Finally, Etzioni has served as a consultant or advisor to Google, Microsoft, Northern Telecom, SAIC, Infospace, Excite, Askjeeves, Zillow, Vivisimo, and others. \n\nIn 1991, Etzioni launched the Internet Softbots project, and in 2003 he launched the KnowItAll project. \nYou have to wonder what he was doing in the intervening 12 years...\n\n\nIn 1997, Etzioni's joint paper on the Ahoy! Softbot was the runner-up for best paper award in WWW6, alas the award itself was snagged by Alta Vista. \nIn 2004, his joint paper on Semantic Email was a runner-up for the best paper award in WWW13... \nAn actual award is coming any day now...really...wait...A Probabilistic Model of Redundancy in Information Extraction snagged the\nDistinguished Paper Award at IJCAI 2005.\n\n\n\n\nEtzioni has been serving as a director of  the non-profit AI Access Foundation  since 1993. The foundation was created by Steve Minton to publish the Journal of AI Research --- one of the very first electronic journals distributed over the Web.  Etzioni has served as an Associate Editor of the ACM Transactions on the Web, on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, on the AAAI Executive Council, as the Program Chair for the Agents Conference, Vice Chair of the WWW Conference Search Track, Area Chair for AAAI's AI and the Web Track, and more.

I was previously with Microsoft Reseach Redmond for 8.5 years. My research interests lie broadly in networked systems. My current work centers on (a) the intersection of sensor systems and mobile computing, and separately on (b) network management. My past projects have spanned a range of areas, including network measurement, wireless networking, RFID, geolocation, network tomography, and peer-to-peer networking. The technologies developed in some of these projects (e.g., the ProbeGap bandwidth probing tool and the GeoCluster technique for learning IP-location mapping) have been transferred to Microsoft's product groups while others (e.g., the RADAR WLAN-based user localization system) have been made available through Microsoft's technology licensing program.\n\nI obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley in September 1998. Professor Randy Katz was my advisor. I had previously obtained an M.S. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 1995 (advised by Professor Domenico Ferrari) and a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1993. \n\nMy Ph.D. thesis, titled Addressing the Challenges of Web Data Transport, proposed two novel techniques, TCP Session and TCP Fast Start, to bridge the disconnect between HTTP and TCP. These techniques provided an alternative to my prior work on persistent-connection HTTP (P-HTTP) done during my internship with Dr. Jeffrey Mogul at the DEC Western Research Lab (now part of HP Labs). The ideas of persistent connections and pipelining in P-HTTP have since been adopted by the IETF HTTP/1.1 standard (RFC 2616).\n\nDetailed lists of my publications, talks, and patents appear on separate pages.",

We take a very integrated approach including theoretical and ecological aspects such as application of mathematical models to field data. While in the field we collect physiological samples from free-living animals, and experimentally manipulate phenotypes (through hormone implants) to tease out mechanisms of control. These data are then integrated with laboratory experiments under rigorously controlled conditions. Endocrine techniques are applied to samples collected both in the field and laboratory and investigations at the cell and molecular level are encouraged. Additional emphasis is emerging in the area of conservation biology and what field endocrinology can contribute to this more applied aspect of biology. My laboratory works primarily with birds, although all vertebrate groups are of interest. Further details can be obtained at our web site.\nMy ongoing projects include the Arctic work, a seasonal breeding project (including field work from equatorial regions to the pole), and a high altitude project looking at hormone-behavior adaptations. Details of some of these studies can be found on my web site. The main thrust of my research is to understand how animals deal with changing environments and adjust their life cycles accordingly. This has led to the initiation of environmental endocrinology that includes a strong theoretical background so we can compare life cycles of all vertebrates from fish to mammals. This framework allows us to keep common mechanisms in mind and make the appropriate experimental comparisons. At present I see a great need to develop molecular techniques to address organismal problems. Specifically, we are pursuing have hormone receptor/metabolising enzyme genes are involved in hormone-behavior adaptations in diverse habitats. Additionally, I think molecular techniques will be important for us to assess population genetics so we can determine whether population differences in hormone-behavior interactions are genetic or environmentally-induced.\nPublications：\nLancaster, L.T., McAdam, A.G., Wingfield, J.C., & Sinervo, B.

Cantley (born February 20, 1949) is an American cell biologist and biochemist and a professor in the Departments of Systems Biology and Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and the Director of Cancer Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, in Boston, Massachusetts. Among his research contributions are the discovery and study of the enzyme PI-3-kinase, now known to be important to understanding cancer and diabetes mellitus.[1][2] He has recently moved to Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.\nCantley grew up in West Virginia, remaining in West Virginia at Wesleyan College where he graduated summa cum laude in chemistry in 1971. Cantley obtained his Ph.D. at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he worked with Gordon Hammes on enzyme kinetics, using FRET to study enzyme conformational changes. In 1975 he moved to Harvard University for a postdoctoral fellowship under Guido Guidotti, where he discovered that an impurity in commercial preparations of ATP, vanadate, acts as a transition state analog for phosphate hydrolysis. In 1978 Cantley became assistant professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Harvard, being promoted to associate professor in 1981. In 1985 he became a full professor in physiology at Tufts University School of Medicine. In 1985 Cantley and colleagues Malcolm Whitman, David Kaplan, Tom Roberts, and Brian Schaffhausen made the seminal discovery of the existence of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). In 1992, Cantley moved to Harvard Medical School as a Professor of Cell Biology and the Director of the Division of Signal Transduction at the former Beth Israel Hospital (now Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). In 2003, Cantley became a founding member of the newly formed Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School. In 2007, Cantley also became the Director of Cancer Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\nCantley is married to Vicki Sato, herself a prominent figure in the pharmaceutical industry and a Professor at Harvard University.",

I am particularly interested in the overlap between natural language understanding and reasoning. While most of the NLP field has moved to statistical learning methods as the paradigm for language processing, I believe that deep language understanding can only currently be achieved by significant hand-engineering of semantically-rich formalisms coupled with statistical preferences. For further discussion of this viewpoint, see the state of NLP . For a more general discussion of AI, see my keynote address from the 1998 AAAI National conference here . The TRIPS project is a long-term effort to build generic technology for dialogue systems (both spoken and 'chat' systems), which we have now pursued for over a decade. This includes broad -coverage domain-general natural language processing, dialogue agents built using models of collaborative problem solving, dynamic context-sensitive language modeling, and a rich engineering framework for building dialogue systems in new domains in short times. We can build robust spoken dialogue systems in significantly less time than it would take to collect and annotate a small starter corpora that would be needed for machine-learning driven approaches. \n",

He developed the first-principles pseudopotentials for the density functional theory (1977), co-developed the momentum-space total-energy method (1978), co-developed what is now the most widely used exchange and correlation energy functional and the self-interaction correction (1981), and developed a novel theoretical method for simultaneous relaxation of atomic positions and charge densities in self-consistent local-density approximation calculations (1983). Recently, he developed novel methods for calculating the electronic properties of semiconductor quantum nanostructures. These atomistic methods have enabled Zunger and his team to discover a range of many-body effects underlying the fundamental physics of the creation, multiplication, and annihilation of excitons.\n\nHis works have established the fundamental understanding of a wide range of materials phenomena in photovoltaic utilization of solar energy materials. The foundational methods he developed in the quantum theory of solids now form an essential integral part of the worldwide activities in the broad field of “First-Principles Theory of Real Solids.”\n\nIn recent years, Zunger has focused on developing the “Inverse Band Structure” concept, whereby one uses ideas from quantum mechanics as well as genetic algorithms to search for atomic configurations that have a desired target property. Zunger also worked on photovoltaic materials, spontaneous ordering in solids (the subject of Zunger’s 2001 Bardeen Award), and quantum nanostructures.",

            "bio": "Judah Folkman was born Moses Judah Folkman in 1933.  The son of a rabbi, he became inspired to become a physician as a young boy when visiting ailing members of the congregation with his father.  He soon became fascinated with science and medicine, and as a high school student he devised a perfusion system in his basement that maintained the viability of a beating rat heart for days after surgical removal.  This led to his admission at age 15 to nearby Ohio State University, where Judah worked part-time all four years in the surgical laboratory of Dr. Robert Zollinger.  He quickly mastered surgical skills and became an active participant in the exciting world of academic surgery.  Judah entered Harvard Medical School at 19, where he was welcomed into the laboratory of Dr. Robert Gross, then Surgeon-in-Chief at Children’s Hospital.  There, he invented the first implantable heart pacemaker.  Based on his scientific contributions, Judah was elected to the AOA and received the Boylston Medical Prize, Soma Weiss Award, and Borden Undergraduate Research Award in Medicine, when he graduated magna cum laude from HMS in 1957.\nJudah authored some 400 peer-reviewed papers and more than 100 book chapters and monographs.  Over 38,000 articles have been published on angiogenesis, the field that he pioneered. He received scores of awards and honors for his distinguished research, including the National Institutes of Health’s Christopher Columbus Discovery Award in Biomedical Research, American Cancer Society’s Medal of Honor for Basic Science, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Award For Distinguished Achievement in Cancer Research, HMS’s Warren Alpert Prize, Canada’s Gairdner Foundation International Award, Israel’s Wolf Foundation Prize in Medicine, Germany’s Ernst Schering Prize, the Italian Association of Cancer Research in Rome’s Gold Medal, the United Kingdom Society for Endocrinology’s Dale Medal, and Switzerland’s Dr. Josef Steiner Cancer Research Award.  Judah also was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Philosophical Society, and membership on the President’s Cancer Advisory Board, in addition to receiving numerous honorary degrees from leading universities around the world. The research lab he founded with a single assistant when he arrived at Children’s Hospital in 1967 had, by the time of his death, grown into a 125 scientist-strong Vascular Biology Program.  And, more than 1000 labs around the world are now pursuing angiogenesis research, yielding thousands of angiogenesis-related publications each year.\nJudah Folkman was an inspirational leader in everything that he did.  For those of us who were blessed with the chance to work closely with him, we remember Judah best for his warmth, his humor, and his incredible mentoring skills.  He mentored from the first light of day until his head hit the pillow and probably thereafter in his dreams.  Most of all, however, Judah mentored by the example of his perseverance, his willingness to move in different directions, and his sheer boyish delight in discovery. Whereas most people saw a lump of coal and spurned others who strived to look further, Judah walked forth boldly, turned it over and found a diamond.  He did this with experiments, but more importantly, he did this with people, whether patients, students, technicians, workmen, colleagues or competitors.  His death on January 14, 2008 was a terrible loss to our community, and to the entire world.  We will all miss him greatly.",

Green, M.D., Ph.D., is the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a position he has held since late 2009. Previously, he served as the NHGRI Scientific Director (2002-2009), chief of the NHGRI Genome Technology Branch (1996-2009), and director of the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (1997-2009).\n\nBorn and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Dr. Green comes from a scientific family. His father, Maurice Green, Ph.D., is a virologist at St. Louis University School of Medicine, where he has directed the Institute for Molecular Virology for over five decades. His brother, Michael Green, M.D., Ph.D., is a molecular biologist at the University of Massachusetts-Worcester, where he chairs the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Cancer Biology and is an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nDr. Green received his B.S. degree in bacteriology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1981, and his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Washington University in 1987. During residency training in clinical pathology (laboratory medicine), he worked in the laboratory of Dr. Maynard Olson, where he launched his career in genomics research. In 1992, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Pathology and Genetics as well as a co-investigator in the Human Genome Center at Washington University. In 1994, he joined the newly established Intramural Research Program of the National Center for Human Genome Research, later renamed the National Human Genome Research Institute.\n\nHonors given to Dr. Green include a Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (1989-1990), a Lucille P. Markey Scholar Award in Biomedical Science (1990-1994), induction into the American Society for Clinical Investigation (2002), an Alumni Achievement Award from Washington University School of Medicine (2005), induction into the Association of American Physicians (2007), a Distinguished Alumni Award from Washington University (2010), the Cotlove Lectureship Award from the Academy of Clinical Laboratory Physicians and Scientists (2011), a Ladue Horton Watkins High School Distinguished Alumni Award (2012), and the Wallace H. Coulter Lectureship Award from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (2012). He is a founding editor of the journal Genome Research (1995-present) and a series editor for Genome Analysis: A Laboratory Manual (1994-1998), both published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. He is also co-editor of the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics (since 2005). Dr. Green has authored and co-authored over 340 scientific publications.\n\nWhile directing an independent research program for almost two decades, Dr. Green was at the forefront of efforts to map, sequence and understand eukaryotic genomes. His work included significant, start-to-finish involvement in the Human Genome Project. These efforts eventually blossomed into a highly productive program in comparative genomics that provided important insights about genome structure, function and evolution. His laboratory also identified and characterized several human disease genes, including those implicated in certain forms of hereditary deafness, vascular disease and inherited peripheral neuropathy.",

He has been at Weizmann since 1980, and is incumbent of the William Sussman Professorial Chair. He was Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from 1989 to 1995, and was Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science from 1998 for seven years.\n\nHe received a BSc from Bar-Ilan University (1974), an MSc from Tel-Aviv University (1976) and a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1978). He spent two years at IBM's Yorktown Heights research center, sabbatical years at Carnegie-Mellon University, Cornell University and the University of Edinburgh, and shorter visiting positions at IBM, Lucent Technologies Bell Labs, DEC, NASA, University of Birmingham, Verimag, the National University of Singapore and Microsoft Research Cambridge. From 1991 to1999 he was an adjunct professor at the Open University of Israel. He was also co-founder of  I-Logix, Inc. in 1984, which was acquired by Telelogic in 2006, and which, in turn, was acquired by IBM in 2008.\n\nIn the past he has worked in several areas of theoretical computer science, including computability theory (see, e.g., this paper and this paper), logics of programs (see, e.g., this book), database theory (see, e.g., this paper), and automata theory (see, e.g., this paper). Over the years, his activity in these areas diminished, and he became involved in several other areas, including software and systems engineering, visual languages, layout of diagrams, modeling and analysis of biological systems, and the synthesis and communication of smell. He has published widely on these topics (see list of publications), including several books. He is the inventor of the language of statecharts (see the 1984 paper for the original version of the language, which has over 8000 citations, the 1997 paper for the OO version, and this paper on its history), and co-inventor of live sequence charts (LSCs; see the 1998 paper), the idea of reactive animation (2002) and behavioral programming (2010). He was part of the team that designed the tools Statemate (1984-1987), Rhapsody (1997) the Play-Engine (2003) and PlayGo (2010). His work is also central to the UML.  He has put forward visions/grand challenges for liberating programming (see this paper), for modeling an entire multi-cellular organism (see this paper), for a system of odor communication and synthesis (see this paper), and recently for wise computing (see this paper).\n\nHe has devoted part of his time to educational and expository work: In 1984 he delivered a lecture series on Israeli radio (see the book version), and in 1998 he hosted a series of programs on Israeli television. Some of his writing is intended for a general audience; see, for example, Computers Ltd.: What They Really Can't Do (2000, 2012) and  Algorithmics: The Spirit of Computing (1987, 1992, 2004, 2012).\n\nHis awards include the ACM Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award (1992), the Stevens Award in Software Development Methods (1996), the Israel Prize (2004), the ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award (2006), the ACM Software System Award (2007), the ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award (2008), the Emet Prize (2010) and the ABZ Platinum Gold Medal from ETH Zurich (2013).\n\nHe has received honorary degrees from the University of Rennes (2005), the Open University of Israel (2006), the University of Milano-Bicocca (2007), the Technical University of Eindhoven (2012) and Bet Berl College (2014). He is a Fellow of the ACM (1994), the IEEE (1995), and the AAAS (2007), and is a member of the Academia Europaea (2006) and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (2010; Vice President as of Sept. 2015), and a foreign member of the US National Academy of Engineering (2014), and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2014).\n\nHe is an ardent peace and human rights activist, and his main hobby is photography.",

            "bio": "Mukherjee has exploited various mediums to get this message across, most recently by allowing an instructive 2010 lecture — titled How to Be a Good Graduate Student — to circulate on the Internet, as a YouTube video.\n\nNo surprise, then, that Mukherjee earned a 2004 Graduate Mentoring Award, granted by the UC Davis Academic Senate on the basis of how an instructor encourages intellectual growth, offers accessibility to students, and demonstrates quality scholarship. In 2009, he also was honored with the UC Davis College of Engineering’s Outstanding Senior Faculty Award.\n\nDuring his career at UC Davis, Mukherjee has supervised to completion the doctorate dissertations of nearly 50 students, and currently is supervising roughly 20 Ph.D. students and research scholars. His students typically achieve a high rate of productivity, publishing in from three to five journals per year; over time, many students have been nominated for the College of Engineering’s “best dissertation” award.\n\nAdditionally, Mukherjee tirelessly helps his students prepare for their careers, and actively involves himself in their job searches.\n\nMukherjee obtained his undergraduate degree in electronics and electrical communications engineering — with honors — in 1980, at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in his native India. He then moved to the United States and obtained back-to-back master’s degrees in computer science and electrical engineering, both at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. This was followed by a Ph.D., also in electrical engineering, from the University of Washington, Seattle. Immediately upon completing his doctorate, in 1987, he joined the UC Davis College of Engineering.\n\nHe quickly established a strong reputation for his work with optical networks and security protocols: specifically, lightwave networks, with the goal of developing novel architectures, protocols and algorithms for the next generation of high-speed networks designed to exploit wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical technology; network intrusion detection, with the goal of detecting network software vulnerabilities and attacks in real time; and wireless and sensor networks. Mukherjee became renowned for his knowledge in these areas, and has become a popular speaker at optical networking conferences throughout the world. He recently served as general co-chair of the 2011 Optical Fibers Communication Conference, held in Los Angeles, and gave keynote/plenary talks at similar conferences held in Cartagena, Spain, and Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nHe also has been a prolific author during his quarter-century at UC Davis, with a staggering list of published articles and research papers to his credit. His graduate-level textbook, 2006’s Optical WDM Networks, remains an invaluable resource to this day; the 956-page book is part of Springer’s Optical Networks series, which Mukherjee edits. He also serves — or has served — on the editorial boards of eight journals, including IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking and IEEE Network. He was made an IEEE Fellow in 2006.\n\nHe served as chair of the UC Davis Department of Computer Science from 1997 through 2000, and in 2005 was appointed to the College of Engineering’s Child Family Professorship, an endowed position that was established to foster academic excellence and innovative research in “the interrelationship of engineering and entrepreneurship.” Upon receiving that professorship, Mukherjee was cited as “an outstanding scholar and teacher, (with) the key industry connections that carry his academic research to practical application.”\n\nOutside academia, Mukherjee was a five-year founding member of the board of directors of IPLocks Inc., a Silicon Valley startup. He also served on technical advisory boards for several other networking startups, including Teknovus, Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems, and LookAhead Decisions Inc.\n\nSomehow, Mukherjee also finds time for several sporting activities each week, with regular games of soccer and squash. In that realm, he’s proudest of his long affiliation with the Davis Cricket Club and the Northern California Cricket League; he’s quick to regale listeners with a memorable game that took place on June 8, 1997, when he and a teammate recorded an unbroken, 280-run opening partnership in an NCCA “B” League game. As a result of that remarkable performance, Mukherjee earned that year’s “B” League Single-Inning Batting Trophy: an honor he probably cherishes just as much as — if not more than — his many academic awards.",

Levine is currently a Professor Emeritus at The Simons Center for Systems Biology at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and a joint Professor in the Pediatrics and Biochemistry Departments at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey. He received his B.A. in Biology from Harpur College, SUNY and his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. \n\nHe trained as a Postdoctoral Fellow at California Institute of Technology in the laboratory of Robert Sinsheimer. Dr. Levine is a widely acclaimed leader in cancer research. In 1979, Dr. Levine and others discovered the p53 tumor suppressor protein, a molecule that inhibits tumor development. He established the Simons Center for Systems Biology at the Institute for Advanced Study, which concentrates on research at the interface of molecular biology and the physical sciences: on genetics and genomics, polymorphisms and molecular aspects of evolution, signal transduction pathways and networks, stress responses, and pharmacogenomics in cancer biology. Dr. Levine helped shape U.S. science priorities as chairman of an influential 1996 review panel on federal AIDS research funding. He also chaired the National Cancer Advisory Board, which advises the National Academy of Sciences and its Institute of Medicine on cancer policy. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1991 and to its Institute of Medicine in 1995. In April 2001, Levine received the first Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research, the largest annual prize in science or medicine offered in the United States.  In 1968 Dr. Levine joined Princeton University as an Assistant Professor, becoming a Professor of biochemistry in 1976.  In 1979, he moved to the SUNY Stony Brook School of Medicine to Chair the Department of Microbiology. He returned to Princeton in 1984. Between 1984 and 1996, he presided over a major expansion of Princeton’s life sciences programs as Chairman of the Department of Molecular Biology. From 1998 to 2002, Dr. Levine was President of The Rockefeller University.",

Kosslyn is Dean of Arts and Sciences at the Minerva Schools at KGI, as well as John Lindsley Professor of Psychology in Memory of William James, Emeritus, in Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n\nKosslyn received his original graduate training in cognitive science, which focused on the intersection of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. Faced with limitations in those approaches, he eventually turned to studying the brain, and is one of the founders of the field of cognitive neuroscience. Research in the Kosslyn Laboratory focused primarily on the nature of visual mental imagery, visual perception, and visual communication, as well as on the uses of imagery in cognition more generally, and on individual and group differences in imagery ability. Convergent methodologies were employed, ranging from behavioral studies to neuroimaging research to computational models.",

            "bio": "Stanley Joel Korsmeyer (8 June 1950 – 31 March 2005) was an American oncologist. Through his studies of apoptosis, Korsmeyer helped develop the concepts of the role of programmed cell death in carcinogenesis. In 1989 Korsmeyer was among the first to confirm that a particular form of lymphoma arose in certain B cells because they had a genetic flaw that caused them to overexpress a gene, Bcl-2, that was involved in the body's normal process for getting rid of them. He then conducted a number of studies defining the activity of a number of related genes and their role in apoptosis.\n\nKorsmeyer obtained a medical doctorate from the University of Illinois at Chicago, completed a residency at the University of California Hospitals in California, and then trained at the National Cancer Institute under Thomas A. Waldmann and Philip Leder. He then became a tenured professor, first at Washington University and then at Harvard at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, working within the Howard Hughes Medical Institute while at both universities. He was widely respected in the field and received numerous prestigious cancer research awards, including the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Cancer Research and the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation Charles S. Mott Prize. He was an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Philosophical Society. The American Society for Clinical Investigation has established a scientific award in his name. In 2000 he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize by Columbia University.\n\nHe has been credited as the author of nearly 20 articles published since his death from cancer in 2005.",

He was fascinated by the possibility of strengthening immunity to pathogens with continually improving methods of immunization. At the beginning of his academic career, Hermann Wagner was working on mechanisms to activate killer T cells and the role played by bacterial superantigens. He completed his research residency in Melbourne at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1973 with a doctoral dissertation about T cell mediated immune responses. At TUM, he worked to make “infection immunology” one of the academic concentrations of the medicine department. In 1995 he was one of the first scientists to discover the importance of toll-like receptors (TLRs) for research into infections and immunology. Having published more than 370 works, Hermann Wagner is one of the most frequently cited immunologists in Europe. He has served as honorary president of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Immunologie (German Society for Immunology), dean of the School of Medicine at TUM and chair of the academic advisory council of the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research in Würzburg (IZKF).",

His research interests concern how the advanced information technologies of ubiquitous computing (or ubicomp) impact our everyday lives when they are seamlessly integrated into our living spaces. Dr. Abowd's work has involved schools and homes, with a recent focus on healthcare delivery. He is a member of the GVU Center.\n\nDr. Abowd currently serves as the Director of the Health Systems Institute, a joint Georgia Tech/Emory University research institute investigating the impact of technologies on healthcare delivery. This extends his own work over the past decade on information technologies and autism.\n\nDr. Abowd directs the Ubiquitous Computing Research Group in the School of Interactive Computing. This effort started with the Future Computing Environments research group in 1995, and has since matured into a collection of research groups, including Dr. Abowd's own group. One of the major research efforts that Dr. Abowd initated is the Aware Home Research Initiative, which he founded in 2000 and directed until 2008.\n\nDr. Abowd received the degree of B.S. in Mathematics in 1986 from the University of Notre Dame. He then attended the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom on a Rhodes Scholarship, earning the degrees of M.Sc. (1987) and D.Phil. (1991) in Computation from the Programming Research Group in the Computing Laboratory.

Xavier Estivill is currently the group leader of the Genomics and Disease group in the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Head of the Genomics and Personalized Medicine Unit, University Hospital Quiron Dexeus, Women's Health Department (Spain).\n\nHis research group is focused on the evaluation of how different types of genetic variants (single nucleotide variants, structural variations, mainly copy number variants, and insertion/deletion variants, including transposable elements) contribute to common and rare human disorders. They are also exploring the contribution of epigenetic modifications and non-coding RNA pathways in complex diseases, mainly neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. They approach these questions through very well characterized cohorts of patients and the use of high-throughput genomic platforms and functional studies including longitudinal studies of patients at different time-points and cohorts in which exposure to environment has been monitored.",

Brooks-Gunn has also designed and evaluated interventions aimed at enhancing the well-being of children living in poverty and associated conditions. She has published over 500 articles and chapters, written 4 books, edited 13 volumes, and been the recipient of numerous major awards and honors.

These include the Early Head Start Follow-Up Study, which is evaluating outcomes at age 10 for children who had participated in Early Head Start as infants or toddlers; researchers are assessing the children, interviewing their mothers, and sending questionnaires to their teachers. She is also conducting a long-term follow-up of the Infant Health and Development Program, an eight-site randomized trial assessing the efficacy of early childhood education and home visiting on the outcomes of low birth-weight children (followed through age 18). She is also conducting a series of studies and evaluations of After School Matters (looking at the effects of extracurricular activities, community activities, and extended day programs on well-being in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood). She is one of the PIs for the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, a study of 7,000 children in 80 neighborhoods over an eight-year period. Current analyses are focusing on ethnic, gender, immigrant, and neighborhood influences on the timing of puberty, sexual onset, and pregnancy, and on changes in anxious, depressive, and aggressive behaviors from ages 3 to 20 (looking at the subjective weathering hypothesis). Brooks-Gunn is also spearheading the Child Care, Schooling and Parental Employment in Fragile Families project, which is adding a child care module to the Fragile Families Study, including child assessments and interviews with providers and parents. She is also responsible for the component of Fragile Families focusing on the schooling experiences of children (school and teacher characteristics, and child school behavior including achievement, attention, and behavior problems). Brooks-Gunn has numerous papers in progress with various collaborators; topics include variation in child care type and quality, predictors of child emotional self-regulation, race/ethnic differences in childhood overweight and obesity, Head Start experiences and child outcomes, maternal employment and child development, father involvement and child behavior, family structure and parenting behaviors, early feeding practices as a function of family structure, immigration status, education, and employment status (as well as the consequences for infant health), and trajectories of couple relationship quality and parenting.",

The objective of his chaos research is to describe those robust properties that are common in the dynamics of physical, biological, and chemical systems.

Fundamental distinctions between such ground states imply that they cannot be smoothly connected to each other (whereas the Landau Fermi liquid is smoothly connected to the independent electron state). Such states are necessarily separated by quantum phase transitions at a quantum critical point (QCP). The QCP has novel properties and usually does not permit a quasiparticle description. Although the QCP is only a special point in the zero temperature phase diagram, it turns out to be a useful point of departure for understanding the physical properties of phases in its vicinity both at zero and non-zero temperatures. Remarkably, it is often the case that quantum mechanics is crucial to understanding the collective properties of 1023 electrons in these materials, even at temperatures as high as room temperature and at the longest time and distance scales.",

            "bio": "John Clifford Mitchell is professor of computer science and (by courtesy) electrical engineer at Stanford University. He has published in the area of programming language theory and computer security.\n\nJohn C. Mitchell is the Vice Provost for Online Learning at Stanford University, the Mary and Gordon Crary Family Professor in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, co-director of the Stanford Computer Security Lab, and Professor (by courtesy) of Education.Under Mitchell's direction, the Office of the Vice Provost for Online Learning (VPOL) is advancing teaching and learning through faculty driven online learning initiatives and research, transforming education in Stanford’s classrooms and beyond.\n\nMitchell’s first research project in online learning started in 2009 when he and six undergraduate students built Stanford CourseWare, an innovative platform that expanded to support interactive video and discussion. CourseWare served as the foundation for initial flipped classroom experiments at Stanford and helped inspire the first massive open online courses (MOOCs) from Stanford that captured worldwide attention in 2011.\n\nThe Office of the Vice Provost for Online Learning was as established in August 2012, after Mitchell served as Stanford University President John L. Hennessy’s special assistant for educational technology and chaired a faculty committee that established initial priorities for Stanford and developed intellectual property guidelines for publicly released online courses.\n\nTo help build faculty experience and a catalogue of online material, Vice Provost Mitchell launched a faculty seed grant program in Summer 2012. This program has helped faculty across campus transform their Stanford campus courses and release public courses to the world, generating informed discussion and debate among faculty in the process.\n\nVPOL offers faculty services in course design — including flipped classes, blended learning experiences, MOOCs, and SPOCs (small private online courses); audio and video production; platform evaluation and hosting; and runs its own data research efforts. VPOL also administers Stanford Online as the gateway to online learning at Stanford.\n\nIn addition to supporting delivery of digital course content, the VPOL engineering team is working to expand the features of Stanford OpenEdX, Stanford’s instance of the open-source release of the edX platform. Mitchell and his team, in partnership with edX, announced the release of Open edX in June 2013: an open-source hosting platform, providing a customizable alternative for all colleges and universities and supporting open educational research and innovation.\n\nStanford’s online courses are generating a wealth of course participant data. In collaboration with Stanford centers of scholarship such as the Lytics Lab, which is jointly supervised by Mitchell and Professor Roy Pea of the Graduate School of Education, VPOL is playing a key role in evaluating educational outcomes and improving online learning based on data-driven research and iterative design.\n\nIn May 2014, VPOL issued a comprehensive report to share benchmark information with other institutions of higher education.\n\n He has served on the editorial board of ten academic journals, acted as consultant and advisor to numerous companies, and spent sabbaticals at the Newton Institute for Mathematical Science and Coverity, Inc. Mitchell is the author of two books, over 170 research papers, and is among the most-cited scholars in computer science.",

We use massive parallel sequencing approaches including whole-genome/exome sequencing and large-scale targeted re-sequencing to identify rare disease-causing and disease-modifying mutations in selected patient cohorts with an apparent high genetic load. This multidisciplinary approach of clinical neurology and molecular genetics has put neurodegenerative brain disease research in Flanders Belgium at the international forefront, as exemplified by the discovery of two major genes for frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis i.e. progranulin (Cruts et al., Nature 2006) and C9orf72 (Gijselinck et al., Lancet Neurology 2012) which are presently under investigation for clinical trials; the observation of a cluster of rare genetic variations delineating the functional role of CLU in Alzheimer disease (Bettens et al., Molecular Neurodegeneration, 2012), and the identification of a functional copy-number-variation increasing the number of C3b/C4b binding sites in CR1 explaining its association with increased Alzheimer risk (Brouwers et al., Molecular Psychiatry 2012).\n\nWe will continue to invest in state-of-the-art strategies and combine our genomic sequencing approaches with additional methodologies including transcriptomics, methylomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Applying a multidimensional ‘Integrative Neuromics’ strategy will increase our molecular discovery efficiency and create multidimensional molecular signatures of neurodegeneration. These signatures will be instrumental in pinpointing candidate biomarkers (diagnostic) and drug targets (therapeutic discovery), as well as allow stratification of heterogeneous patient groups to select most relevant subgroups for eventual remediation trials.",

One project focuses on the problem of image based rendering; capturing the complete flow of light from an object for later rendering from arbitrary vantage points. This work, dubbed The Lumigraph is analogous to creating a digital hologram. Michael also has continued his work on linked figure animation, focusing on means to allow simulated creatures to portray their emotional state. Recent work has focused on computational photography applications. These ranged from creating new methods for low bandwidth teleconferencing, segmentation and matting of images and video, technologies for combining a set of \"image stacks\" as a Photomontage , to the creation of very high resolution panoramas.",

Until March 2003 he was Director of the Swiss Center for Scientific Computing (CSCS) in Manno.\n\n\nBorn in Messina, Italy, in 1945, he obtained his degree in physics in 1968 from Bologna, Italy. Prior to joining ETH, he was Director at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, and previous positions include research staff member at the IBM Research Laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland, and full professor at SISSA, Trieste, Italy.\n\n\nProfessor Parrinello-s scientific interests are strongly interdisciplinary and include the study of complex chemical reactions, hydrogen-bonded systems, catalysis and materials science. Together with Roberto Car he introduced the ab-initio molecular dynamics method, which he is still developing and applying. This method, which goes under the name of Car-Parrinello method, represents the beginning of a new field and has dramatically influenced the field of electronic structure calculations for solids, liquids and molecules. He is also known for the Parrinello-Rahman method of molecular dynamics, which permits the study of crystalline phase transitions under constant pressure. For his research he has been awarded numerous prizes, including the 2001 Award in Theoretical Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, the 1995 Rahman prize of the American Physical Society and the 1990 Hewlett-Packard Europhysics prize.

Before joining Rockefeller in 1983 as Vincent Astor Professor and head of laboratory, he was director of biochemical research at the Geigy Research Laboratories and a professor of pharmacology and psychiatry at Yale University. Since 1995 he has also directed the Fisher Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research at Rockefeller.\n\nDr. Greengard is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among his many awards and honors are the Gold Medal of the Karolinska Institute, the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the 1997 Charles A.

            "work": "The Greengard laboratory studies the molecular defects responsible for neurological and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, as well as the molecular mechanisms by which neuro- and psychoactive drugs produce their pharmacological actions in these disorders. \n\nResearch from the Greengard laboratory has demonstrated that most neurotransmitters and neuromodulators achieve their actions and interactions on postsynaptic neurons through a process called “slow synaptic transmission.” This process involves activation of highly complex signal transduction cascades. For the last 10 years, the group has applied this knowledge to the study of the molecular pathways behind various neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n\nOne major area of activity in the Greengard laboratory involves a search for the molecular and cellular basis of major depressive disorder. They recently found a protein called p11 (S100A10, a member of the S100 family of proteins) that plays a central role in the regulation of mood. Constitutive removal of p11 from neurons in the brain causes a depressive phenotype and a loss of behavioral response to antidepressant agents. Deletion of p11 from one cell type in the nucleus accumbens causes the depressive phenotype, and deletion from any of three other cell types results in the loss of behavioral responses to antidepressants. The antidepressant action of p11 is mediated through binding of p11 to a chromatin-remodeling factor, SMARCA3. SMARCA3, in turn, through activation of various transcription factors, regulates gene transcription. One current project of the research group is to determine which of these genes is necessary for the therapeutic actions of various antidepressants and to determine the molecular mechanisms of action of these gene products.\n\nA second major area of interest of the laboratory is the analysis of the enzymatic pathways involved in the synthesis and degradation of amyloid-β, the prime suspect in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease. The enzyme γ-secretase catalyzes the formation of amyloid-β, the substance believed to be responsible for the death of nerve cells in Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, γ-secretase catalyzes the formation of notch and of many other proteins vital to cell function. The group has recently discovered a protein, which they named γ-secretase activating protein (GSAP), that selectively activates the catalytic formation of amyloid-β by γ-secretase, but not of notch. As a result, inhibitors of GSAP selectively prevent formation of amyloid-β without affecting formation of notch and other vital products. Therefore, GSAP represents a singularly attractive target for the development of drugs to inhibit amyloid-β formation and thus prevent Alzheimer’s disease, without toxic side effects. In other studies in the laboratory, two pathways involved in regulation of amyloid-β degradation have been found, and the mechanisms by which these pathways achieve their effects are being investigated.\n\nA third area of activity of the laboratory involves determining the molecular basis for the differences between vulnerable cells and non-vulnerable cells in Alzheimer’s disease and in Parkinson’s disease. This approach is based on identifying all expressed proteins in individual nerve cell types in the brain using bacTRAP technology, which was developed in collaboration with Rockefeller’s Nathaniel Heintz. Proteins that are highly expressed in vulnerable cells are introduced to non-vulnerable cells to see if they cause vulnerability. Conversely, proteins that are highly expressed in non-vulnerable cells are introduced to vulnerable cells to see if they afford protection.",
