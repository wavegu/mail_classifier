From 1961 to 1990 he worked at the Institute of Control Sciences, Moscow, where he became Head of the Computer Science Research Department. He then joined AT&T Bell Laboratories , Holmdel, NJ, where he now continues as a Consultant, having been appointed Professor of Computer Science and Statistics at Royal Holloway in 1995.\n\nProfessor Vapnik has taught and researched in computer science, theoretical and applied statistics for over 30 years. He has published 6 monographs and over a hundred research papers. His major achievements have been the development of a general theory for minimizing the expected risk of losses using empirical data, and a new type of learning machine called Support Vector machine that possesses a high level of generalization ability. These techniques have been used to solve many pattern recognition and regression estimation problems and have been applied to the problems of dependency estimation, forecasting, and constructing intelligent machines.\n\nHe was one of the invited speakers at the Colloquium \"The Importance of being Learnable\" hosted by the Computer Learning Research Centre at Royal Holloway in September 1998. His current research is presented in his latest book \"Statistical Learning Theory\", ISBN No: 0-471-03003-1.\n\nOn the 10th of February 2006 the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) of USA elected Professor Vapnik as a new member for \"insights into the fundamental complexities of learning and for inventing practical and widely applied machine-learning algorithms\".",

Smith). His empirical findings challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory.With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman established a cognitive basis for common human errors that arise from heuristics and biases (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Kahneman, Slovic & Tversky, 1982; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), and developed prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory.In 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers.In the same year, his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best seller.He is professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. Kahneman is a founding partner of TGG Group, a business and philanthropy consulting company. He is married to Royal Society Fellow Anne Treisman.In 2015 The Economist listed him as the seventh most influential economist in the world.",

His early work focused on visual perception and attention. For example, his first publication in the prestigious journal Science was entitled \"Pupil Diameter and Load on Memory\" (Kahneman & Beatty, 1966). During this period, Kahneman was a visiting scientist at the University of Michigan (1965\u201366) and the Applied Psychology Research Unit in Cambridge (1968/1969, summers).

Turing Award and the National Medal of Science and many other awards for his work in cognitive psychology and computer science, died on February 9, 2001, at the age of 84. Dr. Simon's research ranged from computer science to psychology, administration and economics. The thread of continuity through all of his work was his interest in human decision-making and problem-solving processes and the implications of these processes for social institutions. He made extensive use of the computer as tool for both simulating human thinking and augmenting it with artificial intelligence. Dr. Simon was widely considered to be a founder of the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nA member of Carnegie Mellon faculty since 1949, Simon had important roles in the formation of several of its departments and schools, including the Graduate School of Industrial Administration, the School of Computer Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences' Psychology Department, where he was instrumental in the development of its internationally renowned cognitive science group.",

            "bio": "Krzysztof (Kris) Matyjaszewski is an internationally recognized polymer chemist. He is perhaps best known for the discovery of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), a novel method of polymer synthesis that has dramatically changed the way such molecules are made.\n\nMatyjaszewski received his doctorate from the Center of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1976 and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Florida in 1977. From 1978 to 1984, he was a research associate of the Polish Academy of Sciences. From 1984 to 1985, Matyjaszewski held appointments at the University of Paris, first as a research associate and then as a visiting professor. In 1985, he joined the chemistry department at Carnegie Mellon. He founded and currently directs the university's Center for Macromolecular Engineering. This Center is funded both by an active consortium and government agencies, including the National Science Foundation. In 1998, Matyjaszewski was appointed the J.C. Warner Professor of Natural Sciences. In 2004 he was named a University Professor, the highest distinction faculty can achieve at Carnegie Mellon. Mayjaszewski is also an adjunct professor in Carnegie Mellon's department of materials science and engineering.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1998, Matyjaszewski served as head of the Department of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon and assisted in recruiting additional faculty with strengths in polymer chemistry. At the same time, he formed a research consortium with various industrial corporations to expand the understanding of controlled radical polymerization, including ATRP, and accelerate the transfer of this technology to different commercial applications. A second consortium, the CRP Consortium, formed under his leadership in 2001, continues and expands these efforts, training university and industrial scientists in procedures for responsive polymeric material development.Matyjaszewski is a co-inventor on 51 issued U.S. patented technologies, holds 143 international patents and has 36 active U.S. patent applications.\n\nOne of the leading educators in the field of polymer chemistry, Matyjaszewski has 14 current doctoral students and 5 postdoctoral fellows. He has mentored more than 200 undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students since joining Carnegie Mellon. He has authored 17 books, 83 book chapters and more than 870 peer-reviewed scientific papers. His work has been cited in the scientific literature more than 68,000 times, making him one of the most cited chemists in the world.\n\nMatyjaszewski has received numerous awards for his work, including the 2012 Dannie-Heineman Prize from the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences, 2011 Wolf Prize in Chemistry and the 2009 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award. He has been honored by the American Chemical Society (ACS) with its inaugural AkzoNobel North America Science Award in 2013, 2011 Applied Polymer Science Award, 2007 Hermann F. Mark Senior Scholar Award, 2004 Cooperative Research Award in Polymer Science & Engineering, 2002 Polymer Chemistry Award, and the 1995 Carl S. Marvel Creative Polymer Chemistry Award. He also received the 2005 UK Macro Medal for outstanding achievements in polymer science, 1995 Humboldt Award for Senior U.S. Scientists and a 1989 Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation. In 2006, he was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, in 2014 a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors, in 2010 a fellow in the ACS Polymer Division, and in 2001 he was elected an ACS Polymeric Materials Science and Engineering Fellow.[citation needed] He is also a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and an honorary member of the Chinese Chemical Society and Israel Chemical Society.\n\nMatyjaszewski\u2019s work has been recognized in his native country of Poland. In 2004, he received the Annual Prize of the Foundation of Polish Science, the most prestigious scientific award in Poland, referred to as the Polish Nobel Prize. In 2005 he became a foreign member of the Polish Academy of Science, and in 2007, he received an honorary degree from Polytechnic University of Lodz in Poland. He has also received honorary degrees from the University of Ghent, Belgium, Russian Academy of Sciences, University of Athens, Greece, Polytechnic Institute in Toulouse, France, and Pusan National University in South Korea.",

            "bio": "Donald P. Schneider, Distinguished Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics, has been appointed as head of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Penn State's Eberly College of Science. Schneider succeeds Lawrence W. Ramsey, who has served as head of the department since 2003.\n\nSchneider, whose primary research interest is observational cosmology, perhaps is best known for three of his accomplishments: He developed a new technique to measure distances to galaxies; he was the first to detect Comet Halley as it approached Earth in 1982, at a greater distance than any comet had ever been detected up to that time; and he has broken his own and others' records numerous times in the discovery of the most-distant known object in the universe.\n\nSchneider now is particularly interested in finding and determining the properties of distant quasars, which are thought to be massive black holes that are swallowing stars as they venture to close to the black hole. He uses optical telescopes as time machines to view the distant past, when the universe was only a small fraction of its current size and age.\n\nFor the past two decades, much of his research effort has been devoted to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which is a large international effort to produce a comprehensive digital map of the sky. Schneider has served as the chairman of the quasar science group and as the science publications coordinator for the project. The first two phases of the survey, completed in July 2008, identified 100,000 quasars -- the most luminous objects known in the universe -- and have measured the distances to over a million galaxies. During the third phase of the survey, which is ongoing until May 2014, Schneider is serving two roles: as the project's survey coordinator and as a member of its Management Council. Since 2004, Schneider also has served as the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Scientist.\n\nIn 2006, Schneider received a C.I. Noll Award for Excellence in Teaching, which is sponsored by the Eberly College of Science Student Council and Alumni Society and is presented annually to faculty members and instructors in the Eberly College of Science who demonstrate a record of excellence both in teaching and in their interactions with students. For the past several years, Schneider has taught a year-long introductory course for astronomy majors and has been active in placing students in research programs throughout the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nSchneider received a bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics, with highest distinction, from the University of Nebraska in 1976 and, in 2002, he received the University's Alumni Achievement Award. He received a doctoral degree in astronomy from the California Institute of Technology in 1982 and was a research fellow there from 1982 to 1985. From 1985 to 1994, he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

            "bio": "George M. Whitesides (born August 3, 1939) is an American chemist and professor of chemistry at Harvard University. He is best known for his work in the areas of NMR spectroscopy, organometallic chemistry, molecular self-assembly, soft lithography,microfabrication, microfluidics, and nanotechnology. A prolific author and patent holder who has received many awards, he received the highest Hirsch index rating of all living chemists in 2011.",

            "work": "Research at MIT[edit]\nWhitesides began his independent career as an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963 and remained there until 1982.[6] He continued his work with NMR spectroscopy and organometallic compounds, as well as working with polymers.[7] Collaborations with biologists at MIT were an early influence informing his later work with biological systems.[6] He is credited as having played a \"pivotal role\" in the development of the Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction.[8]\n\nResearch at Harvard[edit]\nIn 1982, Whitesides moved back to the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University, his alma mater, taking his laboratory with him.[6] He was the Mallinckrodt Professor of Chemistry from 1982-2004.[9] At Harvard, Whitesides has served as chairman of the Chemistry Department (1986\u201389)[10] and Associate Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (1989\u201392).[11]\n\n\nCurrent research\n\n\nIn 2004, Whitesides was appointed the Woodford L. and Ann A. Flowers University Professor at Harvard,[12] one of only 24 University Professorships at the institution as of 2014.[13] He is cofounder and director of the Whitesides Research Group at Harvard, an active research group of graduate and postdoctoral students with a lab space covering more than 6,000 square feet (560 m2).[4] The single primary objective of his lab is \"to fundamentally change the paradigms of science.\"[14]\n\nWhitesides' interests include \"physical and organic chemistry, materials science, biophysics, complexity and emergence, surface science, microfluidics, optics, self-assembly, micro- and nanotechnology, science for developing economies, catalysis, energy production and conservation, origin of life, rational drug design, cell-surface biochemistry, simplicity, and infochemistry.\"[9] He has shifted to new research areas many times throughout his career, averaging about ten years in any particular area. Once other people successfully move into an area, he tends to look for new and more interesting problems to solve.[6] \"He has done that repeatedly by asking fundamental questions of what seemed to everyone to be virtually intractable problems,\" according to Jeremy R. Knowles.[6]\n\nWhitesides has made scientific contributions in diverse areas, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), microfluidics and nanotechnology. He is particularly well known for his work in materials and surface science. His work in surface chemistry has examined the 'self-assembly' processes of molecules arranging themselves on a surface. This work has become a basis for developments in nanoscience, electronics, pharmaceutical science and medical diagnostics.[15] Some of his research has been visually presented through the collaboration On the Surface of Things: Images of the Extraordinary in Science with photographer and artist Felice Frankel.[16] One image, a pattern of blue and green water droplets, was featured on a 1992 cover of Science.[17]\n\nEarly work by Ralph G.

Allara on spontaneously organized molecular assemblies informed Whitesides' work on soft lithography.[6] Whitesides and his research group have made significant contributions by developing techniques for soft lithography and microcontact printing. Both microscale and nanoscale techniques are based on printing, molding and embossing, and can be used for the fabrication of patterns and features on many different materials. Soft lithography uses a patterned elastomer as a stamp, mold, or mask to create micropatterns and microstructures.[18][19] Such techniques have now become standard in the field.[6]\n\nMore recent research interests include energy,[20] the origin of life,[21] and science for developing economics.[22]\n\nWhitesides is also known for publishing his \"outline system\" for writing scientific papers.[23]",

Roberts.[5] At Caltech, Whitesides began working in organic chemistry. Whitesides' graduate work in organometallic chemistry used NMR spectroscopy and density matrices to study Grignard reagents.[6] He used NMR spectroscopy to study rate of change of Grignard reagents[7] and the structure of Grignard reagents in solution. He also studied spin-spin coupling in a variety of organic compounds, using density matrix calculations to examine the spin systems that NMR analyses detect.[6]",

            "bio": "In the hallways at scientific meetings, countless scientists have debated the same question: \"How many species need to be sequenced to know whether evolution has conserved a given stretch of DNA?\" One computational biologist, Sean Eddy, has done the math. \n\nIn the January 2005 issue of PLoS Biology, Eddy, who at the time was an HHMI investigator at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, described a mathematical model that puts hard numbers on the need to keep sequencing genomes from diverse organisms. According to the model, in order to detect invariant single nucleotides conserved in evolution, researchers would need to compare about 17 genomes separated by the average evolutionary distance between humans and mice. \n\nWhat's more, more than two dozen genomes are needed to do the same job when conserved nucleotides are allowed to change at a more rapid, realistic rate. To reduce the error rate from 1 in 100 to 1 in 10,000, about 120 such genomes should be compared. Notably, far fewer genomes are required to detect conserved features larger than a single nucleotide. \n\nFor Eddy, huge numbers\u2014not to mention the letters A, T, C, and G\u2014are all in a day's work. He designs mathematical tools to probe modern genomes, unraveling the structures, functions, and histories of specific genes. In particular, Eddy works to identify genes that make functional RNAs instead of proteins. \n\nTo identify noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes, for example, Eddy's lab has developed statistical models describing the pattern of mutation expected in these genes versus the different mutation patterns commonly found in protein genes. With these models, they can scan genome regions to find areas that likely contain ncRNA genes. Eddy's team has used this approach to predict a few hundred new RNA genes in the genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli, some of which they've confirmed experimentally. The lab also is conducting computational screens for new ncRNA genes in humans, nematodes, and yeast, among other organisms. Because ncRNA genes tend to be small and are inherently immune to frameshift or nonsense mutations, they are hard to find by classical mutational genetic screens. They are also difficult to recognize in genomes because they do not have open reading frames and thus cannot be discovered by gene-finding programs. \n\nAs a group leader at Janelia Farm, Eddy will bring his research program\u2014and considerable computational savvy\u2014to the new campus. He anticipates being a high-tech service provider, fulfilling some of the needs of the other group leaders, such as comparing given gene sequences across genomes. \n\nAlthough Eddy does not yet have a defined research plan for his Janelia Farm lab, he's planning to branch out\u2014or back, as the case may be. As a postdoctoral fellow at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge during the 1990s, Eddy originally planned to study the neural circuits behind basic behaviors such as learning and memory, but his research project got scooped by a colleague with similar interests. \n\n\"My dream is to switch back to what I set out to do in the first place,\" Eddy says. \"At Janelia Farm, I can integrate my work with neurobiology, and I can take my time in developing a research program.\" He's also drawn to Janelia Farm for the promise of a culture of collaboration and focused science. \"The Farm is unique because it will have a whole research enterprise designed, from the ground up, to invent new technologies alongside science.\"\n",

Pearl is recognized for his work in artificial intelligence and philosophy of science, especially through the invention of Bayesian networks, a formalism that enables computers to reason with uncertainty. He is also credited with developing a calculus of causation that has algorithmitized counterfactuals and allows empirical scientists to quantify and discover cause-effect relationships from statistical data. Pearl was born in Israel, in 1936, and graduated from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, in 1960, with a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering. He came to the United State in 1960 to do post graduate work and received a Master degree in Physics from Rutgers university and a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now NYU-Poly). Until 1969, he held research positions at RCA David Sarnoff Research Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey and Electronic Memories, Inc, Hawthorne, California. Pearl has joined the faculty of UCLA in 1969, where he currently directs the Cognitive Systems Laboratory. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and a Founding Fellow of the American Institute of Artificial Intelligence.

He was an NSF postdoctoral fellow at Penn State University from 1988-1991, where he performed catalytic antibody research with Professor Steve Benkovic. Rich began his academic career in 1992 in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Wayne State University.  As an Assistant and Associate Professor Rich made seminal contributions to the areas of medicinal and bioorganic chemistry, and the synthesis and mechanistic evaluation of anticancer drugs. Rich continued this research throughout his tenure at Wayne State and at Purdue University, where he moved to in 2001 as a Professor of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology. He also served as the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs in the College of Pharmacy at Purdue.  \n\n\nRich\u2019s research was focused on mechanistic and inhibitory studies of protein prenyltransferases and related enzyme targets, and the design and synthesis of chemical probes of protein prenylation.  Many key signal transduction proteins are modified by prenylation of a cysteine residue, followed by a specific proteolytic cleavage step and finally methylation. This has led to intense interest in protein-farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitors as potential cancer chemotherapeutic agents, and such compounds are currently in human clinical trials. Rich\u2019s laboratory employed chemical biology approaches to address two key questions in the field of protein prenylation. They explored the substrate specificity of FTase, with the goal of developing potential isoprenoid-based inhibitors or modulators of protein prenylation. Secondly, they used synthetic isoprenoid analogues and labeled derivatives as probes of the biological function of protein prenylation. Rich also developed a new stereospecific route to isoprenoids to synthesize novel, specifically substituted analogues of FPP, the isoprenoid substrate of FTase. This program led to the development of a series of potent inhibitors of FTase and farnesol analogues that are potent inhibitors of the growth of certain human tumor cells in vitro.",

            "bio": "Prof. Leiserson's research centers on the theory of parallel computing, especially as it relates to engineering reality. He wrote the first paper on systolic architectures with H.T. Kung and invented the retiming method for digital circuit optimization. He designed and led the implementation of the network architecture for the Connection Machine Model CM-5 Supercomputer produced by Thinking Machines Corporation, which incorporated the fat-tree interconnection network he developed at MIT. Fat-trees are now the preferred interconnect strategy for Infiniband technology. His textbook, Introduction to Algorithms, coauthored with Ronald L. Rivest and Thomas H. Cormen was named \"Best 1990 Professional and Scholarly Book in Computer Science and Data Processing\" by the Association of American Publishers. Currently in its third edition with an additional coauthor Clifford Stein, it has sold over 500,000 copies and, according to Citeseerx, is the second most cited publication in computer science. On leave from MIT as Director of System Architecture at the Internet start-up Akamai Technologies, he led the engineering team that developed a world-wide content-distribution network numbering over 20,000 servers. He introduced the notion of cache-oblivious algorithms, which exploit the memory hierarchy near optimally while containing no tuning parameters for cache size or cache-line length. He developed the Cilk multithreaded programming technology, which featured the first provably efficient work-stealing scheduler. He led the development of several Cilk-based parallel chess-playing programs which have won numerous prizes in international competition. With his former student Matteo Frigo, he founded Cilk Arts, Inc., which developed the Cilk++ multicore concurrency platform and was acquired by Intel Corporation in 2009. He was for many years the head of the computer-science program for the Singapore-MIT Alliance distance-education collaboration. His annual workshop on Leadership Skills for Engineering and Science Faculty, cotaught with Chuck McVinney, has educated hundreds of faculty at MIT and around the world in the nontechnical issues involved in leading technical teams in academia. He is a Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellow at MIT, the highest recognition at MIT for undergraduate teaching. He is an ACM Fellow and a senior member of IEEE and SIAM.",

This expansion gives rise to a small benign colon tumor (called a polyp or adenoma). This clonal expansion and subsequent growth of the tumors appears to be caused by mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and the whole process is accelerated by defects in genes required for maintaining genetic instability.  Mutations in four or five such genes are required for a malignant tumor to form, while fewer mutations suffice for benign tumorigenesis. As the mutations accumulate, the tumors become progressively more dangerous.\n\nCurrent studies are aimed at further characterization of the mechanisms through which these genes act, the identification of other genes that play a role in this tumor type, and the application of this knowledge to patient management.    Genetic tests for risk assessment, pre-symptomatic detection of tumors, and prognosis have been devised and are constantly being improved.  Novel therapeutic agents that target the specific defects in cancer are under development.",

In this work, I'm trying to use data mining techniques to analyze expression profiles of genes and find groups of genes that behave similarly, and determine the underlying genetic regulatory network.\nMy research in parallel processing is focused on developing scalable parallel algorithms for emerging applications and architectures. This includes research on data intensive applications, scientific computing, architectures with deep memory hierarchies, and architectures with heterogeneous interconnection networks.\nMy recent research has led to the development of a number of highly efficient and scalable software packages and algorithms such as METIS (a serial sparse graph partitioning software), ParMETIS (an MPI-based parallel graph partitioning software), hMETIS (a circuit partitioning software), PSPASES (a parallel direct solver), and CHAMELEON (a spatial clustering algorithm).",

            "bio": "Klaus Schulten is a leader in the field of computational biophysics, having devoted over 40 years to establishing the physical mechanisms underlying processes and organization in living systems from the atomic to the organism scale. Schulten is a strong proponent of the use of simulations as a \"computational microscope\", to augment experimental research, and to lead to discoveries that could not be made through experiments so far. The molecular dynamics and structure analysis programs NAMD and VMD, born and continuously developed in his group, are used today by many thousands of researchers across the world. Schulten contributed key discoveries to several areas of biological physics: from quantum biology of vision, photosynthesis, and animal navigation to ion channels employed in neural signaling and to neural network organization of brain function; from mechanically gated channel proteins to muscle protein mechanics; from mathematical physics of non-equilibrium processes to numerical mathematics of the classical many-body problem. While Schulten's work remains solidly anchored to molecular detail, his most recent work has advanced to molecular cell biology and molecular systems biology via his group's structure analysis method, Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting, applied to systems such as the 300,000 atom ribosome and 4 million atom asymmetric HIV capsid. As of 2013, Schulten's work in biological physics has produced over 650 publications, which have been cited over 75,000 times (Google Scholar) as of February 2015. Schulten believes strongly in the importance of educating the next generation of scientists, having graduated 80 PhD students so far, many today in distinguished academic positions. He developed new courses and textbooks, and organizes a popular series of hands-on training workshops in which he has trained, in small groups, over 1,000 young scientists.",

He also attended several Cardiology courses in Mexico City, at the Instituto Ignacio Chavez. He always thought that the Mexican School of Cardiology was above any other. \"We have the technology but they have the practice. The best book of cardiology is the patient itself,\" he always argued.\n\nIn 1952, Braunwald married Nina Starr, a thoracic surgeon and medical researcher, with whom he had three children.Nina Starr Braunwald died in 1992.",

His current research is focused on the mathematical analysis and modeling of the combinatorial structure of networks and information. His recent work includes an improvement to the HITS algorithm which he developed at IBM's Almaden Research Laboratory as a Visiting Scientist in the CLEVER project. HITS is a very influential algorithm of his, conceptually similar to the PageRank algorithm of Larry Page and Sergey Brin. In fact, some credit Kleinberg's work as the inspiration for PageRank.\n\nMany students affectionately call him the \"Rebel King\" (an anagram for \"Kleinberg\"). The \"Rebel King\" phenomenon began in an undergraduate course taught by Jon Kleinberg, when an unknown student entered the lecture hall in the middle of the class, announced in a loud voice that \"Kleinberg is Rebel King,\" and then promptly left the lecture hall. The \"Rebel King\" tradition continued in subsequent years, when subsequent classes taught by Jon Kleinberg received similar visits from an unknown student who again announced loudly that \"Kleinberg is Rebel King\" before making a rapid exit. While co-teaching a class with Eva Tardos students also made an anagram of her name \"Astro Dave\" which has not caught on. The most recent of these incidents occurred on |March 9, |2007 when two unknown students, shirtless and adorned with red paint,entered the lecture hall of Kleinberg's class on network structures, chanted \"Long Live the Rebel King\" and ran out another exit. Kleinberg's popularity among students is due in part to his excellence in teaching, which was formally recognized when Cornell's Association of Computer Science Undergraduates awarded him the \"Faculty of the Year\" award in 2002.\n\nHe has written numerous prominent papers and articles, including a recent textbook on algorithms, Algorithm Design, co-authored with \u00c9va Tardos and published by Addison-Wesley.\n\nHis work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, and grants from the NSF.

My first project, as a Ph.D student was the development of PC/Gene, an MS-DOS based software package for the analysis of protein and nucleotide sequences. PC/Gene was commercialized, first by a Swiss company (Genofit) then by Intelligenetics in the US which was later bought by Oxford Molecular.\nWhile working on PC/Gene I started to develop an annotated protein sequence database which became SWISS-PROT. It was first released in July 1986. From 1988 onward it has been a collaborative project with the Data Library group of the EMBL which has now became the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). SWISS-PROT has grown both in size, in its scope and in the amount of work and people necessary to produce it.\n\nIn 1988, I started to develop PROSITE, a database of protein families and domains. A little while later I created ENZYME, a nomenclature database on enzymes as well as SeqAnalRef, a sequence analysis bibliographic reference database.\n\nIn collaboration with Ron Appel we initiated, in August 1993, the first molecular biology WWW server, ExPASy. What was intended as a prototype grew rapidely into a major site that provides access to the many databases produced partially or completely in Geneva as well as many tools for the analysis of proteins (proteomics).\n\nIn the last four years I was involved with colleagues in Geneva and Lausanne in setting-up the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), whose mission is to establish in Switzerland a center of excellence in the field of bioinformatics with an emphasis on research, education, services and the developments of databases and tools. I am currently one of the six group leaders of the SIB.\n\nIn November 1997, together with Ron Appel and Denis Hochstrasser we founded GeneBio (Geneva Bioinformatics SA), a company involved in biological knowledge.\n\nIn April 2000, the above persons with Keith Rose and Robin Offord founded GeneProt (Geneva Proteomics), a high throughput proteomics company.\n",

Dehaene was one of ten people to be awarded the James S. McDonnell Foundation Centennial Fellowship[3] in 1999 for his work on the \"Cognitive Neuroscience of Numeracy\". In 2003, together with Denis Le Bihan, Dehaene was awarded the Louis D. Prize from the Institut de France.[4] In 2014, together with Giacomo Rizzolatti and Trevor Robbins, he was awarded the brain prize.Dehaene is best known for his work on numerical cognition, a discipline which he popularized and synthesized with the publication of his 1997 book, The Number Sense (La Bosse des maths) which won the Prix Jean-Rostand (fr) for best French language general-audience scientific book. He began his studies of numerical cognition with Jacques Mehler, examining the cross-linguistic frequency of number words,[6] whether numbers were understood in an analog or compositional manner,[7][8] and the connection between numbers and space (the \"SNARC effect\").[9] With Changeux, he then developed a computational model of numerical abilities, which predicted log-gaussian tuning functions for number neurons,[10] a finding which has now been elegantly confirmed with single-unit physiology[11] With long-time collaborator Laurent Cohen, a neurologist at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital in Paris, Dehaene also identified patients with lesions in different regions of the parietal lobe with impaired multiplication, but preserved subtraction (associated with lesions of the inferior parietal lobule) and others with impaired subtraction, but preserved multiplication (associated with lesions to the intraparietal sulcus).[12] This double dissociation suggested that different neural subtrates for overlearned, linguistically mediated calculations, like multiplication, are mediated by inferior parietal regions, while on-line computations, like subtraction are mediated by the intraparietal sulcus. Shortly thereafter, Dehaene began EEG[13][14] and functional neuroimaging[15][16][17] studies of these capacities, showing that parietal and frontal regions were specifically involved in mathematical cognition, including the dissociation between subtraction and multiplication observed in his previous patient studies. Together with Pierre Pica, and Elizabeth Spelke, Stanislas Dehaene has studied the numeracy and numeral expressions of the mundurucu (an indigenous tribe living in Para, Brazil).",

Gunn's early theoretical work in astronomy has helped establish the current understanding of how galaxies form, and the properties of the space between galaxies. He also suggested important observational tests to confirm the presence of dark matter in galaxies, and predicted the existence of a Gunn\u2013Peterson trough in the spectra of distant quasars.\n\nMuch of Gunn's later work has involved leadership in major observational projects. He developed plans for one of the first uses of digital camera technology for space observation, a project that led to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the most extensive three-dimensional mapping of the universe ever undertaken. He also played a major role with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera on the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nGunn earned his bachelor's degree at Rice University in Houston, Texas, in 1961, and his Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1966.

He began his career in the United States the following year as an associate scientist at the Wistar Institute of Biology and Anatomy in Philadelphia. In 1980, he was named Wistar Professor of Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania and associate director of the Wistar Institute, titles he held until 1988. From 1988-91, he was director of the Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology at Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia. In 1991, Dr. Croce was named Director of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Jefferson Medical College at the Thomas Jefferson University, in Philadelphia. While at Jefferson, he discovered the role of microRNAs in cancer pathogenesis and progression, implicating a new class of genes in cancer causation. In 2004 he moved to The Ohio State University. Under his direction at Ohio State faculty within the Human Cancer Genetics Program conduct both clinical and basic research. Basic research projects focus on how genes are activated and inactivated, how cell-growth signals are transmitted and regulated within cells, and how cells interact with the immune system.

Fundamental to this work has been the development of methods to measure dietary intake in large populations. Thus we have devoted substantial ongoing effort to the creation and refinement of standardized dietary questionnaires that can be completed repeatedly by subjects over a number of years. Such questionnaires have now been demonstrated to provide reasonably accurate assessments of a wide spectrum of dietary factors. In addition, we continue to work on the development and evaluation of biological markers of dietary intake, particularly using plasma and toenail samples. These biological indicators are primarily utilized in nested case-control studies using the large specimen banks collected prospectively as part of our ongoing studies.Education\n\nM.D., 1970, University of Michigan Medical School\nM.P.H. 1973, Harvard School of Public Health\nDr.P.H., 1980, Harvard School of Public Health, Epidemiology\nChair, 1991, Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health",

He qualified in medicine at Oxford University and Guy's Hospital, trained as a histopathologist and obtained a PhD in the molecular biology of cancer at the Institute of Cancer Research, London.\n\nHis primary research interests have been in the genetics of cancer. His early work focused on inherited susceptibility.

He went to the University of Chicago and trained in neurology, neuropathology, and neurosciences and served on the faculty there for 10 years, from 1983 until 1993. Thereafter, he was a professor of neurology, neuropathology and neuroscience at Harvard University, from 1993 until 1997. Concurrently at that time, he was director of neuropathology at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, from 1993 to 1996. While in Boston, he and his colleague Jeffrey Gulcher decided to return to Iceland to perform genetic studies to determine multiple sclerosis risk.\nK\u00e1ri Stef\u00e1nsson founded DeCode Genetics in 1996 in the midst of concerns about privacy related to a large centralized healthcare database and the commercial use of health information and genetics. As of 2003, nearly 100,000 of 285,000 Icelandic citizens have consented and given blood to DeCode Genetics for analysis.[3] The process has linked the country\u2019s genetics profiles with medical records and genealogy information. This has led to the discovery of the neuregulin-1 gene's association with schizophrenia, a condition that Stef\u00e1nsson\u2019s brother has.[4] In 2007, his compensation was $662,296.[5] He was on the Time 100 list in 2007.\n\nAlthough the company was bankrupt in 2009, it resumed its data collection in 2014 after it was purchased by Amgen, by sending out another 100,000 envelopes to add to the 120,000 samples already taken.[6]\n\nA website named after the Icelandic history \u00cdslendingab\u00f3k has made it possible for Icelanders to see a relatively complete genealogy of all Icelanders.

Decision Research is a collection of scientists from all over the nation and in other countries that study decision-making in times when risks are involved. He was also the president for the Society of Risk Analysis until 1984. He earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford University in 1959 and his Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Michigan in 1964 and has received honorary doctorates from the Stockholm School of Economics and the University of East Anglia.[1] He is past president of the Society for Risk Analysis and in 1991 received its Distinguished Contribution Award. In 1993, he received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association, and in 1995 he received the Outstanding Contribution to Science Award from the Oregon Academy of Science.\n\nDr. Slovic studies human judgment, decision making, and risk perception, and has published extensively on these topics. He is considered, with Baruch Fischhoff, a leading theorist and researcher in the risk perception field (the psychometric paradigm,[2] the affect heuristic, and \"risk as feeling\"[3]).\n\nHis most recent work examines \u201cpsychic numbing\u201d[4] and the failure to respond to mass human tragedies.\nMajor Theories\uff1a\nAffect Heuristic - This is the ability to make a quick emotional decision in time of crisis. Slovic says that even if there is a bad situation, if we have positive feelings toward something it lowers people\u2019s perception of risks but enhances their perception of benefits.[6]\n\nSlovic contributed towards the psychometric paradigm of risk perception. He found that people usually perceived most activities as having a high risk. He also found that if someone gained pleasure from something they saw the risk level being low. This shows that risk levels can depend on the individual\u2019s personal belief and emotions of a specific risk.[7]\n\nPsychophysical Numbing - This is the idea that people are not as affected by the loss of life depending on how it is presented. Slovic says that people cannot connect on an emotional level when being presented with large numbers.",

Faraone completed a postdoctoral clinical psychology internship and a research fellowship at Brown University.\n\nAfter completing his post-doctoral fellowship at Brown, Faraone came to the Harvard Department of Psychiatry where he began a career in psychiatric genetics. He first served as an instructor in 1985, and as an Assistant Professor in 1989. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1993 and Full Professor in 2002. In 2004 he moved to SUNY Upstate Medical University where he is now Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and of Neuroscience and Physiology. He is also Senior Scientific Advisor to the Research Program Pediatric Psychopharmacology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and a lecturer at Harvard Medical School. Faraone is principal investigator on several National Institutes of Health funded grants studying the nature and causes of mental disorders in childhood. He is one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on the genetics of psychiatric disorders and has also made substantial contributions to research in psychopharmacology and research methodology.",

These two disorders frequently occur together and cause numerous problems for patients and their families.  We need new medicines for these disorders because the ones we use now are only partially effective or cannot be used widely because they cause other problems.  Importantly, no medicines can currently cure or prevent these disorders.  The Faraone Lab searches for genes that cause ADHD and autism and figures out how these genes differ from genes in other children.  We then study how these genes work together with networks of other genes in brain cells.  By learning how defects in risk genes for ADHD and autism disturb the functioning of these networks, we find new targets for medicines.",

Hogness at Stanford University, where he participated in some of the earliest studies of gene organization using the newly developed recombinant DNA methods.\nIn 1982, he and Allan Spradling developed methods for making transgenic Drosophila, the first successful germ-line genetic engineering of a multicellular animal. Rubin served as the leader of the publicly funded effort to sequence the Drosophila melanogaster genome, which included collaborating with Celera Genomics Inc. to demonstrate that the whole genome shotgun method could successfully sequence an animal genome. Rubin held faculty positions at Harvard Medical School and the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Embryology before moving to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1983 to assume the John D. MacArthur Professorship (held until 1999). He became a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator in 1987. Rubin served as HHMI's vice president for biomedical research (2000\u2013\u00962002) and vice president and director of planning for Janelia Research Campus (2002), and he became vice president and executive director, Janelia Research Campus in 2003.

His research concerns understanding global climate and its variations using observations and covers the quasi biennial oscillation, Pacific decadal oscillation and the annular modes of the Arctic oscillation and the Antarctic oscillation, and the dominant spatial patterns in month-to-month and year-to-year climate variability, including the one through which El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon in the tropical Pacific influences climate over North America. He is also the coauthor with Peter V. Hobbs of what is generally considered the standard introductory textbook in the field: Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey. He was the third most cited geoscientist during the period 1973\u20132007.\nMy research and that of my students has been directed at improving our understanding of global climate and its year-to-year and decade-to-decade variations, making use of observational data. We have contributed to the identification and understanding of a number of atmospheric phenomena, including the vertically propagating planetary waves that drive the quasi-biennial oscillation in zonal winds in the equatorial stratosphere, the 4-5-day period easterly waves that modulate daily rainfall over the tropical oceans, and the dominant spatial patterns in month-to-month and year-to-year climate variability, including the one through which the El Nio phenomenon in the tropical Pacific influences climate over North America. We have contributed to documenting the existence of El Nino- like variability on a decade to decade time scale (the so called 'Pacific Decadal Oscillation'). We are currently investigating two analogous patterns of weather and climate variability: the Northern and Southern Hemisphere 'annular modes' which have played a prominent role in the climatic trends of the past 30 years.",

            "bio": "I am a professor for computer science at the University of Freiburg and head of the research lab for Autonomous Intelligent Systems. My areas of interest lie in artificial intelligence and mobile robots.<br /><br />My research mainly focuses on the development of robust and adaptive techniques for state estimation and control. Over the past years my group and I have developed a series of innovative probabilistic techniques for robot navigation and control. They cover different aspects such as localization, map-building, SLAM, path-planning, exploration, and several other aspects.<br /><br />In my previous position from 1996 to 1999 at the University of Bonn I was head of the research lab for Autonomous Mobile Systems. In 1997 we deployed Rhino as the first interactive mobile tour-guide robot in the Deutsches Museum Bonn in Germany (see corresponding overview article). In 1998 my group and I went to Washington, DC, to install the mobile robot Minerva in the Smithsonian Museum of American History. Afterwards we produced several robots that autonomously operated in trade shows and Museums. In 2008, we developed an approach that allowed a car to autonomously navigate through a complex parking garage and park itself. In 2012, we developed the robot Obelix that autonomously navigated like a pedestrian from the campus of the Faculty of Engineering to the city center of Freiburg.I have published over 250 papers and articles in robotic and artificial intelligence conferences and journals. In 2005, I co-authored two books. Whereas the first one, entitled Principles of Robot Motion - Theory, Algorithms, and Implementations, is about sensor-based planning, stochastic planning, localization, mapping, and motion planning, the second one, entitled Probabilistic Robotics, covers robot perception and control in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn 2008, I became a Fellow of the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI).\n\nIn 2009, I became a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).\n\nIn 2009, I received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, the most prestigious German research award.\n\nIn 2010, I received an Advanced Grant of the European Research Council.\n\nSince 2012, I am the coordinator of the Cluster of Excellence BrainLinks-BrainTools funded by the German Research Foundation.\n\nA large fraction of my publications is available at Google Scholar.\n\nMy Erd\u00f6s number is at most 4.\n\nDetailed Curricula Vitae are available in English and German.",

Biologic samples have been collected in each of the cohorts, sometimes repeatedly. Using a nested case-control design, the samples are analyzed for a variety of markers of cancer (and other outcomes). We examine a wide range of topics in these studies, but a major focus is on nutrition. We use food frequency questionnaires, diet records, anthropometry, and biochemical analyses of serum, plasma, DNA, RNA, red cells, adipose tissue, tumor tissue, and toenails. These studies investigate many health outcomes including cancer, and precursors such as polyps, benign breast disease, and obesity. We are also initiating studies in cancer survivorship, including quality of life.\n\nThe major focus of my research is in prostate cancer, for etiology, diagnosis, prognosis and secondary prevention. I have a particular interest in pathoepidemiology, gene expression and prostate cancer risk and prognosis. \n\nMost of my teaching is at the Harvard School of Public Health, where I teach the Practice of Epidemiology.

            "bio": "Dr. Karin was born in Tel Aviv, Israel and received the Bachelor of Science degree in 1975 from Tel Aviv University, with a major in Biology. In 1975 he arrived in the US and in 1979 received a Ph.D. degree in Molecular Biology from the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Karin followed his graduate studies with postdoctoral fellowships at the Fox Chase Institute for Cancer Research, working in the laboratory of Dr. Beatrice Mintz, and the laboratory of Dr. John Baxter at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Karin joined the faculty at the University of California, San Diego in 1986, where currently he is a Distinguished Professor of Pharmacology.\n\nDr. Karin has received numerous awards including the Oppenheimer Award for Excellence in Research from the Endocrine Society in 1990, an American Cancer Society Research Professorship in 1999, the C.E.R.I.E.S. Research Award for Physiology or Biology of the Skin in 2000, the Harvey Prize in Human Health in 2011, the Brupbacher Prize in Cancer Research in 2013 and the William B. Coley Award for Distinguished Research in Basic and Tumor Immunology in 2013. Dr. Karin was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2005, as a Foreign Associate of EMBO in 2007, and to the Institute of Medicine in 2011. Dr. Karin also serves on several advisory boards and was cofounder of Signal Pharmaceuticals (currently Celgene).\n\nDr. Karin has spent his entire academic career investigating stress and inflammation signaling covering the entire gamut of research approaches from basic biochemistry through molecular cell biology to animal pathophysiology. After discovering how environmental stress caused by either infection, inflammation or exposure to toxic substances leads to activation of AP-1, NF-\u03baB and other transcription factors, his lab began to examine the role of the key signaling pathways controlling these transcription factors in the pathogenesis of cancer, degenerative and metabolic diseases. The Karin group has identified some of the fundamental mechanisms through which inflammation and obesity promote tumor development and progression and contribute to type II diabetes. They had established the mechanisms through which members of the IL-6 cytokine family contribute to the development of colorectal and liver cancer through activation of STAT3 and other transcription factors. They had also established the complex and cell type specific mechanisms through which NF-\u03baB activation via I\u03baB kinases (IKK) controls development and progression of colon, liver and prostate cancers. They were amongst the first to demonstrate that not only innate immune cells, such as macrophages, but also adaptive immune cells, including T regulatory cells and B lymphocytes, also contribute to tumorigenesis and its progression. Through this work, Dr. Karin has contributed to the founding of the Inflammation and Cancer field.",

Dr. Karin also serves on several advisory boards and was cofounder of Signal Pharmaceuticals (currently Celgene). He is a leading world authority on signal transduction pathways that regulate gene expression in response to extracellular stimuli, infection, inflammation and stress. Key achievements include the definition of cis elements that mediate gene induction by hormones, cytokines and stress, identification and characterization of the transcription factors that recognize these elements (members of the AP-1/ATF family) and the protein kinase cascades that regulate their activities, including the Jun kinases (JNK) and IkB kinases (IKK). Much of Dr. Karin\u2019s current activity is focused on understanding the link between inflammation, cancer and metabolic disease as well as on understanding the signaling mechanisms used by receptors involved in inflammation and innate immunity. In addition to establishing molecular links between obesity, inflammation and cancer, this work has revealed new targets for cancer prevention and therapy. Dr. Karin has published over 300 scientific articles and is an inventor on over 30 different patents or pending patent applications. In addition to numerous honors, Dr Karin was ranked first worldwide by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) in a listing of most-cited molecular biology and genetic research papers published in prestigious journals.",

During this period he was on 50% leave from the University of Cambridge.\n\nHis major research interests are now the structure and evolution of genomes. Most of his research has been with the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, about which he has written the standard research text (Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook, Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York, 1989, 2nd ed. 2005). His research has covered a range of subjects, from classical genetics, developmental biology, cytogenetics to evolution, at both molecular and organismal levels. He was a member of the consortium which recently sequenced the entire genome of this fly. He has had a strong interest in the provision of databases for biologists for about 15 years. He is a founder of FlyBase, a major database for researchers using Drosophila as a model organizer, and of the Gene Ontology Consortium, a project to provide infrastructure for biological databases by a defined taxonomy of gene function.

            "bio": "Paul is the Development Manager for Whole Page Relevance (WPR) at Bing.  His team provides the glue between the frontend \u201cUX\u201d and backend \u201cweb relevance\u201d.  Among other features, the WPR team provides query suggestions, determines how results are arranged on the page, and measures overall user satisfaction.\n\n \n\nPaul came to Microsoft as a Researcher in 2002.  Before moving to Search, Paul and his team worked on numerous efforts to use machine learning in the analysis of documents, emails, and web pages.  Results of this work can be seen in products like Windows, Live Search, and Microsoft Dynamics.  In collaboration with the Live Toolbar team we built the technology behind \u201csmart menus\u201d.  The Tablet PC team uses our technology to extract the structure in handwritten ink notes.  East Asian Office is using his technology to extract contact information from incoming emails.  Dynamics/CRM is using his technology to automatically route and analyze incoming faxes.   Live Search uses similar technology to classify and extract information from documents and queries.\n\n \n\nPaul has served on the program committees of conferences such as Neural Information Process Systems (NIPS), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), and the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).  He has received the Marr Prize for the best paper in computer vision (at ICCV 2003).  An earlier paper on medical image processing received an honorable mention for the Marr prize in 1995.  He received an honorable mention for best paper at AAAI 2004. While at MIT he received the NSF Career award as one of the top junior faculty members in Computer Science.\n\n \n\nPaul\u2019s interest in intelligent systems goes back quite a ways.  As an IBM intern in 1986, Paul Viola constructed a semi-autonomous robotic wheel chair called \u201cMr. Ed\u201d.  This ride-on robot incorporated sensors and a microprocessor,  and required no more than coarse and infrequent feedback to navigate a hallway,  or go through a doorway.  Until 1990,  he studied robotics with Rod Brooks at MIT.  There he received a master\u2019s degree for the construction of an autonomous visual robot patterned on the simple mammalian oculomotor processes.  After brief forays into neuroscience and structural molecular biology (at Arris Phamaceutical now Axys), Paul returned to MIT to complete his Ph.D. on biomedical image processing.\n\n \n\nPaul\u2019s thesis work on the registration of images from various medical sensors has been widely used and reimplemented (his thesis has been referenced more than 800 times).  It is now a standard technique that appears in many commercial products,  and is widely considered the best and most reliable registration technique for assistance in surgical planning.  \n\n \n\nIn 1995, Dr. Viola returned to MIT as an assistant professor and later an associate professor.  His work focused on statistical learning for image processing and computer vision.   In the area of computer graphics his work with Jeremy De Bonet is considered the first effective texture synthesis algorithm for complex textural patterns.  Other work included techniques for image database retrieval and 3D reconstruction.\n\n \n\nWhile visiting Compaq Cambridge research labs in 2000,  he created the world\u2019s first real-time face detection system.  This system has been widely adopted and reimplemented: Intel distributes this algorithm in a computer vision toolkit;  MSRA has adopted and improved the algorithm.  Though it was developed outside of MS, it is actually in wide use inside of MSR (as well as many other companies and universities).  After leaving MIT to join the Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, he worked on face recognition, surveillance, and real-time computer vision.\n",

Clarke received a B.A. degree in mathematics from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, in 1967, an M.A. degree in mathematics from Duke University, Durham NC, in 1968, and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Cornell University, Ithaca NY, in 1976. After receiving his Ph.D., he taught in the Department of Computer Science, Duke University, for two years. In 1978 he moved to Harvard University, Cambridge, MA where he was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the Division of Applied Sciences. He left Harvard in 1982 to join the faculty in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. He was appointed Full Professor in 1989. In 1995 he became the first recipient of the FORE Systems Professorship, an endowed chair in the School of Computer Science. He was named a University Professor in 2008\n\nDr. Clarke's interests include software and hardware verification and automatic theorem proving. In his Ph.D. thesis he proved that certain programming language control structures did not have good Hoare style proof systems. In 1981 he and his Ph.D. student Allen Emerson first proposed the use of Model Checking as a verification technique for finite state concurrent systems. His research group pioneered the use of Model Checking for hardware verification. Symbolic Model Checking using BDDs was also developed by his group. This important technique was the subject of Kenneth McMillan's Ph.D. thesis, which received an ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award. In addition, his resarch group developed the first parallel resolution theorem prover (Parthenon) and the first theorem prover to be based on a symbolic computation system (Analytica).\n\nDr. Clarke has served on the editorial boards of Distributed Computing, Logic and Computation, and IEEE Transactions in Software Engineering. He is the former editor-in-chief of Formal Methods in Systems Design. He is on the organizing committee of Logic in Computer Science (LICS) and on the steering committee of  Computer-Aided Verification (CAV). He received a Technical Excellence Award with Randy Bryant and Ken McMillan from the Semiconductor Research Corporation in 1995 for his work on formal verification techniques. He was a co-winner with Randy Bryant, Allen Emerson, and Kenneth McMillan of the ACM Kanellakis Award in 1998 for the development of Symbolic Model Checking.  In 1999 he received an Allen Newell Award for Excellence in Research from the Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Department.  In 2004 he received the IEEE Harry H. Goode Memorial Award for significant and pioneering contributions to formal verification of hardware and software systems, and for the profound impact these contributions have had on the electronics industry.  He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2005 for contributions to the formal verification of hardware and software correctness.  He was a recipient with Allen Emerson and Joseph Sifakis of the 2007 ACM Turing AwardModel Checking into a highly effective verification technology, widely adopted in the hardware and software industries.  In 2008 he received the CADE Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Reasoning in recognition of his role in the invention of Model Checking and his sustained leadership in the area for more than two decades.

Over a period of nearly 40 years he made many fundamental and pioneering contributions to nearly every area of that field. He wrote the first textbook in the field (1969); was founding editor of its first journal (1972); and was co-chairman of its first international conference (1987).

My group is engaged in research efforts to develop management and scheduling techniques that empower high throughput computing on local and wide area clusters of distributively owned resources. The results of these efforts are translated into production code and are incorporated into the Condor system. Condor is a widely used high throughput computing system. The worldwide user community of Condor plays an important and active role in our research. Researchers from a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines collaborate with us in the development and evaluation of Condor.\nIn the area of visual exploration of information my group works on developing a framework and tools for intuitive graphical interaction with collections of multimedia data. Our framework is based on a declarative approach to the creation of active visual presentations of tabular data. We implement our tools in Java and work closely with domain scientists on testing and evaluating them with real data. Some of this data is stored in scientific databases that are connected to real-time and off-line data sources.",

He began his academic career that same year as Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of Missouri. In 1981 he was promoted to Associate Professor, and in 1985 he was named the Frederick A. Middlebush Professor of Psychology at Missouri. After a sabbatical at Yale University in 1986, he returned to Ohio State in 1987 as Professor of Psychology and Director of the Social Psychology Doctoral Program. In 1995, he was visiting Professor of Psychology at Princeton University. In 1998, he was appointed Distinguished University Professor at Ohio State. He served as chair of the psychology department from 1998-2002 and again from 2008-present.\n\nPetty's research focuses broadly on the situational and individual difference factors responsible for changes in beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Much of his current work (and that of the students and colleagues with whom he collaborates) is aimed at examining the implications of the Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion for understanding prejudice, consumer choices, political and legal decisions, and health behaviors. Topics of special current interest include: understanding the role of meta-cognitive as well as implicit factors in persuasion and resistance to change; the effect of racial and ethnic prejudice and specific emotions on social judgment and behavior; and investigating how people correct their evaluations for various factors they think may have biased their judgments (such as stereotypes they hold or emotions they are experiencing). \n\nIn addition to his empirical work on basic processes in attitudes, persuasion, and social cognition, Petty has served as a consultant and panelist for federal agencies such as the National Academy of Sciences Committees on Dietary Guidelines Implementation to Improve the Health of Americans and a Social Psychology of Aging, the National Institute on Drug Abuse panel on Using Persuasive Communication to Prevent Drug Abuse, and the National Science Foundation panel on the Human Dimensions of Global Change. He is also former chair of the National Institute of Mental Health grant review panel on Social and Group Processes. \n\nAmong the honors and awards he has received are the following: In 1995, Petty received the Distinguished Scholar Award from Ohio State University. In 1999, he was named Distinguished Scientist-Lecturer for the American Psychological Association. In 2000, he received the award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Consumer Psychology from the Society for Consumer Psychology, and in 2001 he received the Donald T. Campbell Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Social Psychology from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. Petty is a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychological Society. After serving as Associate Editor of the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin from 1982-1984, he became the journal's editor from 1988-1991. He has also served as Associate Editor for the APA journal, Emotion, and on the editorial boards of Psychological Review, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, the Personality and Social Psychology Review, the Journal of Consumer Research, the Journal of Consumer Psychology, the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, and Media Psychology. Petty served as President of the Midwestern Psychological Association in 2001-2002, and as President of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in 2009.",

He is known for developing a series of methods that have found wide application in analytical protein chemistry and proteomics like a new class of reagents termed Isotope Coded Affinity Tag (ICAT) reagents used in quantitative mass spectrometry. Prof. Dr. Aebersold and his team of researchers use the protein profiles determined by this method to differentiate cells in different states, such as noncancerous versus cancerous cells, and to systematically study how cells respond to external stimuli. These \"snapshot\" profiles indicate which cells contain abnormal levels of certain proteins. This is expected to lead to new diagnostic markers for disease and to a more complete understanding of the biochemical processes that control and constitute cell physiology.\nProf. Aebersold serves on the Scientific Advisory Committees of numerous academic and private sector research organizations and is a member of several editorial boards in the fields of protein science, genomics, and proteomics.\nProf. Aebersold is a native of Switzerland and obtained his Ph.D. in Cellular Biology at the Biocenter of the University of Basel in 1983. Since that time, he is a faculty member of the Universities of Washington and British Columbia, until 2000, when he co-founded the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. In 2004, he accepted a position as full professor at the Institute of Biotechnology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, where in January 2005, his research group became the first integral part of the newly founded Institute of Molecular Systems Biology.",

Small populations of immature nerve cells are found in the adult mammalian brain, a process called Neurogenesis. Gage is working to understand how these cells can be induced to become mature functioning nerve cells in the adult brain and spinal cord.

            "bio": "Detlef Weigel (born 1961 in Lower Saxony, Germany) is a German American scientist working at the interface of developmental and evolutionary biology.\nWeigel was an undergraduate in biology and chemistry at the universities of Bielefeld and Cologne. In 1986, he graduated with a Diploma in biology for this thesis on Drosophila neurogenesis with the late Jos\u00e9 Campos-Ortega. In 1988, he moved to the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in T\u00fcbingen. During his PhD work with Herbert J\u00e4ckle, he discovered the founding member of an important class of transcription factors, the Forkhead/FOX proteins.[1][2] In 1988, he graduated with a PhD (summa cum laude) from the Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t.\n\nWeigel began to work with plants during his postdoctoral research with Elliot M. Meyerowitz at Caltech, where he cloned the floral regulator LEAFY from Arabidopsis thaliana.[3] From 1993 to 2002, he was an Assistant and then Associate Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla. In 2002, he accepted an appointment as Scientific Member and Director at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, where he founded the Department for Molecular Biology. He is also an Adjunct Professor at the Salk Institute and the University of T\u00fcbingen.\nDuring the 1990s, Weigel mostly studied the development of individual flowers and how the onset of flowering is regulated. His group made important discoveries in both areas. Together with Ove Nilsson, he demonstrated that transfer of the LEAFY gene from Arabidopsis thaliana to aspen trees was sufficient to reduce the time to flowering from years to months.[4] Weigel and his team isolated the FT gene,[5] which was later found to be an important component of the mobile signal inducing flowering.[6] New genetic tools developed by his group led to the discovery of the first microRNA mutant in plants.[7]\n\nThrough his study of factors that control the onset of flowering, a quintessential adaptive trait, Weigel became interested in more general questions of evolution. Apart from work on genetic variation in environment-dependent developmental processes, his group is known for the generation of extensive genomic resources, such as the first haplotype map for a non-mammalian species.[8][9] To further exploit and advance the understanding of genetic variation, Weigel and colleagues initiated the 1001 Genomes project for Arabidopsis thaliana. Related to this is a new area of interest, in reproductive isolation. In collaboration with Jeffery Dangl, his group discovered that genetic barriers in plants are often associated with autoimmunity. In work led by former postdoc Kirsten Bomblies, now an Assistant Professor at Harvard, they could show that in certain hybrid offspring, specific gene products contributed by one of the parents may be inappropriately recognized as foreign and pathogenic, and thus trigger pervasive cell death throughout the plant.",

In both areas, we study the functions of T-cell surface molecules and their interactions with intracellular signal transducing components.\nDuring development, CD4 and CD8 glycoproteins are co-expressed on immature thymocytes (double-positive cells), which are then selected according to their ability to interact productively with host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on thymic epithelium. Cells with T-cell receptors specific for MHC class I shut off CD4 and commit to becoming cytotoxic cells, while cells with T-cell receptors for MHC class II shut off CD8 and become helper cells. We use gene targeting and transgenic technology in mice to study how the double-positive cells commit to either of the two major T-lymphocyte lineages.\n\nIn our studies with immunodeficiency viruses, we seek to understand how the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with CD4 and various chemokine receptors on the target cells results in membrane fusion and viral entry. We are also developing mouse model systems to determine how HIV infection causes loss of CD4+ helper T cells. In related studies, the functions of chemokine receptors in development and in inflammatory responses are being investigated.",

His most celebrated breakthroughs are the invention of quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation, both universally recognized as fundamental cornerstones of the entire discipline. His other influential discoveries include privacy amplification, entanglement distillation, amplitude amplification and the first lower bound on the power of quantum computers. Through his visionary thinking and groundbreaking research, Professor Brassard has played a pivotal role in transforming the field of quantum information science from what was initially perceived to be merely a fringe pursuit into an area of vigorous and dynamic international activity.[17] \u201d \n\nOn December 30, 2013 the Governor-General of Canada, the Right Honourable David Johnston, announced that Gilles Brassard has been named as an Officer in the Order Of Canada.",

            "bio": "Antoine Bechara is a Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Southern California. His research marks three key accomplishments that resulted in a significant influence on the field. The first is his development of what became known as the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). This work began in Iowa with Antonio R. and Hanna Damasio using the brain lesion method to study the decision-making capabilities of patients who have suffered injury to the ventromedial sector of their prefrontal cortex. At the time, the decision-making deficit seen in these patients presented a puzzling defect because their impairment was so obvious in their real life, but there was no clinical test that detects and measure this decision-making impairment. Many of these challenges were overcome after his development of the IGT. His work has certainly drawn attention to the potential value in studying the neural basis of decision-making, and in bringing this question to the laboratory through the use of structured decision-making tasks involving choices that mimic real-life situations, in the way they factor uncertainty, reward, and punishment (e.g., see Bechara et al., Cognition, 2004; Bechara and Damasio, Games and Economic Behavior, 2005). The second is his application of the work on decision-making from neurological patients to understanding the mechanisms of decision-making in certain psychiatric disorders, namely addiction. He was among the first who argued that addiction is also a disorder of impaired decision-making (impaired prefrontal cortex), and not just a disorder of abnormal mesolimbic dopamine, as it was the predominant view at the time (e.g., see Bechara, Nature Neuroscience, 2005). The third is his finding that the insula is critical for smoking addiction (and potentially other substances of abuse). This finding brought to light the potential role of a new neural region, which was completely ignored in the past, in the psychopathology of addiction (e.g., see Naqvi et al., Science, 2007). Thus his research helped lead the way of integrating decision neuroscience with research in two key areas: one is mental health, and this includes substance addiction, but it also extends to several other psychopathologies such as bipolar and impulse control disorders (e.g., see Yechiam et al., Psychological Science, 2005); the other is the social sciences where his work helped contribute to the strengthening of the integration between the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and social sciences, including economics, marketing, and consumer behavior. Indeed some of these areas in the social sciences became very interested in understanding the brain mechanisms that underlie human choice, and why do people choose the way they do in social contexts such as financial investment (e.g., see Shiv et al., Psychological Science, 2005).",

            "bio": "My research program has three main aspects. The first and central component is work on the development and testing through computer simulation of methods for the analysis of DNA sequence data. We have developed methods for estimating gene genealogies, detecting recombination, detecting selection, and measuring genetic diversity and demographic events in the history of a population. We develop software to implement many of these methods and then develop software to test our methods and many others by comparison through computer simulation. Through comparison and tests of robustness to assumption violations, we can gain great insights into why particular methods perform well or poorly and then are in a good position to redevelop improved methodology. In fact, we are currently embarking on the development of a comprehensive simulation software package that allows one, for the first time, to examine the impact of a host of population genetic phenomena at the same time (e.g., migration, mutation, recombination, selection, fluctuating population sizes, tracking geographic locations of alleles in a population, multiple locus populations, etc.). Through such studies, we gain a better understanding of the methodology we use to infer evolutionary and population demographic histories and associated parameter estimates when we apply them to empirical data. Furthermore, such studies provide valuable insights into the development of new and improved theory and methodology for inference from DNA sequence data.",

He works on the mathematical description of evolutionary processes, including the evolution of cooperation and human language, as well as the dynamics of virus infections and human cancer. His major scientific contributions and discoveries include: the mechanism of HIV disease progression; the rapid turnover and evolution of drug resistance in HIV infection; quantifying the dynamics of HBV infection; the evolution of virulence under superinfection and coinfection; the role of chromosomal instability in human cancer; quantifying the dynamics of chronic myeloid leukemia; the accumulation of drivers and passengers in cancer progression; the evolution of drug resistance in targeted cancer therapy; the mechanisms for the evolution of genetic redundancy; \"generous tit-for-tat\" and \"win-stay, lose-shift\"; the alternating Prisoner's Dilemma; the evolution of cooperation by indirect reciprocity; spatial game dynamics; adaptive dynamics; evolutionary game dynamics in finite populations; evolutionary graph theory; the five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation; the evolution of eusociality by natural selection; a mathematical approach for studying the evolution of human language; the dynamics of language regularization; culturomics; \"winners don't punish\"; prelife; and the origin of evolution.\n\nAn Austrian by birth, he studied biochemistry and mathematics at the University of Vienna with Peter Schuster and Karl Sigmund. He received his Ph.D. sub auspiciis praesidentis in 1989. He went on to the University of Oxford as an Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger Scholar and worked there with Robert May, the later Lord May of Oxford, with whom he co-authored numerous articles and his first book, Virus Dynamics (2000). Nowak was a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College and later at Keble College. He was also a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow. Nowak became head of the mathematical biology group at Oxford in 1995 and Professor of Mathematical Biology in 1997. A year later, he moved to Princeton to establish the first program in theoretical biology at the Institute for Advanced Study. He accepted his present position at Harvard University in 2003.\n\nA corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Nowak is the recipient of numerous prizes, including the Weldon Memorial Prize of Oxford University, the David Starr Jordan Prize of Stanford University, and the Akira Okubo Prize of the Society for Mathematical Biology. Nowak is the author of over 350 papers and four books. Evolutionary Dynamics (2006) provides an overview of the powerful yet simple laws that govern the evolution of living systems. SuperCooperators (2011) argues that cooperation is the third fundamental principle of evolution beside mutation and selection.",

            "bio": "Elizabeth F. Loftus (born Elizabeth Fishman, in 1944)[2][3][4] is an American cognitive psychologist and expert on human memory. She has conducted extensive research on the malleability of human memory. Loftus is best known for her ground-breaking work on the misinformation effect and eyewitness memory,[5] and the creation and nature of false memories,[6] including recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse.[7] As well as her prolific work inside the laboratory, Loftus has been heavily involved in applying her research to legal settings; she has consulted or provided expert witness testimony for hundreds of cases.[7][8] Loftus has been recognized throughout the world for her work, receiving numerous awards and honorary degrees. In 2002, Loftus was ranked 58th in the Review of General Psychology\u2019s list of the 100 most influential psychological researchers of the 20th century, and was the highest ranked woman on the list.\nLoftus received her Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and psychology with highest honors from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1966. She received her MA in 1967 and Ph.D in 1970 (both in mathematical psychology and both from Stanford University), the only woman in her cohort.[3] Her thesis was entitled \"An Analysis of the Structural Variables That Determine Problem-Solving Difficulty on a Computer-Based Teletype.\"[13] Loftus took her first academic appointment in 1970 at the New School for Social Research in New York City.[3] Her research during her time there focused on the organization of semantic information in longterm memory.[3] However Loftus soon realized she wanted to do research with greater social relevance.[13] Loftus attributes this realization in part to a conversation with an acquaintance to whom she was describing her findings about semantic memory, who wondered at the cost of the research compared to its value.In 1973 Loftus accepted an assistant professorship at the University of Washington and used the new position to begin a new line of research into how memory works in real-world settings,[3][7][10] beginning the empirical study of eyewitness testimony.[8] One of the first studies she conducted was the reconstruction of automobile destruction study,[10] in which she found that the way in which questions were worded altered the memories subjects reported.[5][10] Loftus\u2019 next step was to investigate whether asking leading questions, or providing misleading information in other forms, might also affect people\u2019s memory for the original event.[5] To answer this question she developed the misinformation effect paradigm, which demonstrated that the memories of eyewitnesses are altered after being exposed to incorrect information about an event and that memory is highly malleable and open to suggestion.[5][8][11] The misinformation effect became one of the most influential and widely known effects in psychology,[5] and Loftus\u2019 early work on the effect generated hundreds of follow-up studies examining factors that improve or worsen the accuracy of memories, and to explored the cognitive mechanisms underlying the effect.",

Quasars and AGNs are galaxies in which new material is currently falling into supermassive black holes at their centers. He is particularly interested in understanding the accretion disks that feed these massive black holes, how mass and energy ejected from these black holes influences the evolution of galaxies over time, and how large quasar samples can be used as statistical probes of the structure of the Universe.\n\nRichards frequently uses both space-based observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, and Chandra X-ray Observatory in addition to ground-based observatories such at the 4-m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Very Large Array radio telescope. He serves as the co-deputy chair of the SDSS quasar working group and is a member of the AGN science collaboration for the upcoming LSST project. He is co-author of 145 articles in refereed journal and is frequently invited to give talks on his work, including recent talks in Paris, Marseilles, and Munich.

I have worked on a number of issues in early vision, including image restoration, visual correspondence, and motion-based tracking. My recent work with Y. Boykov and O. Veksler provides novel algorithms for a fundamental class of vision problems whose previous solutions required exponential time. Our results rely on the application of recent results from graph theory, which can provide efficient algorithms that generate provably good answers. \n  \n\nI am also exploring a number of different applications of computer vision, with an emphasis on automating visual tasks. One of the most important applications is in the area of content-based access to image databases. While large collections of digital imagery are becoming commonplace, the tools available for accessing image databases are still quite primitive. My past work with G. Pass and with J. Huang et al. focused on this problem for collections of static images. In ongoing research, V. Kettnaker and I are addressing the issue for video, where we hope to exploit some insights about the role of contextual information in the human visual system. I am also working with Microsoft on automating some visual tasks that occur in the development of programs with graphical user interfaces. "

He invented statistical parametric mapping (SPM), voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and dynamic causal modelling (DCM). These contributions were motivated by schizophrenia research and theoretical studies of value-learning \u2013 formulated as the dysconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia. Mathematical contributions include variational Laplacian procedures and generalized filtering for hierarchical Bayesian model inversion. Friston currently works on models of functional integration in the human brain and the principles that underlie neuronal interactions. His main contribution to theoretical neurobiology is a free-energy principle for action and perception (active inference). Friston received the first Young Investigators Award in Human Brain Mapping (1996) and was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (1999). In 2000 he was President of the international Organization of Human Brain Mapping. In 2003 he was awarded the Minerva Golden Brain Award and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2006. In 2008 he received a Medal, Coll\u00e8ge de France and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of York in 2011. He became of Fellow of the Society of Biology in 2012, received the Weldon Memorial prize and Medal in 2013 for contributions to mathematical biology and was elected as a member of EMBO (excellence in the life sciences) in 2014.",

This laboratory was founded in 1990. On February 24 2010 he was appointed the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\nDr. Kikinis is the Principal Investigator of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC, a National Center for Biomedical Computing, an effort which is part of the NIH Roadmap Initiative), and of the Neuroimage Analysis Center (NAC a National Resource Center funded by NCRR). He is also the Research Director of the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), which is jointly sponsored by NCRR, NCI, and NIBIB and co-director of the IGT program at CIMIT.\nDuring the mid-80's, Dr. Kikinis developed a scientific interest in image processing algorithms and their use for extracting relevant information from medical imaging data. Since then, this topic has matured from a fairly exotic topic to a field of science. This is due to the explosive increase of both the quantity and complexity of imaging data. Dr. Kikinis has led and has participated in research in different areas of science. His activities include technological research (segmentation, registration, visualization, high performance computing), software system development (most recently the 3D Slicer software package), and biomedical research in a variety of biomedical specialties. The majority of his research is interdisciplinary in nature and is conducted by multidisciplinary teams. The results of this research have been reported in a variety of peer-reviewed journal articles. He is the author and co-author of more than 260 peer-reviewed articles.\nBefore joining Brigham & Women's Hospital in 1988, he trained as a resident in radiology at the University Hospital in Zurich, and as a researcher in computer vision at the ETH in Zurich, Switzerland. He received his M.D. degree from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, in 1982.",

My interests in mobile and wireless systems are largely because of my work at Bell Labs where my group built one of the first wireless ATM system. Prior to that, I did my graduate work in the EECS Department at Bob Brodersen in the general area of CAD tools for embedded DSP VLSI and system design. My M.S.  project (1988) was on CMOS bit-slice datapath compilation as part of the  Lager silicon compiler for DSP VLSI, while my Ph.D. dissertation (1992) was on hardware-software rapid prototyping and co-design at the board level for embedded DSP and control applications. Going even further back in time, I received my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT, Kanpur in India in 1985, and did my prior schooling at the Colvin Taluqdars' College in Lucknow, India - the city where I grew up.

He received his bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Harvard University in June 1986 where he was the first Harvard student to \"major\" in Computer Science.   Etzioni received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in January 1991, and joined the University of Washington's faculty in February 1991, where he is now a Professor of Computer Science.    Etzioni received a National Young Investigator Award in 1993, and was selected as a AAAI Fellow a decade later.  In 2007, he received the Robert S. Engelmore Memorial Award.  He is the founder and director of the University of Washington's Turing Center.\n\n\nEtzioni is the author of over 100 technical papers in a wide range of conferences including AAAI, ACL, CIDR, COLING, EMNLP, FOCS, HLT,  ICML, IJCAI, ISWC, IUI, KDD, KR, SIGIR, and WWW.  He is a founder of three companies (see below) and a Venture Partner at the Madrona Venture Group.   His work has been featured in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, NPR, SCIENCE, The Economist, TIME Magazine, Business Week, Newsweek, Discover Magazine, Forbes Magazine, Wired, NBC Nightly News, and even Pravda.\n\n\nHis current research interests include:  fundemental problems in the study of intelligence,  Web search, Machine Reading, and Machine Learning. \n\nEtzioni is the founder of Farecast---a company that utilizes data mining techniques to anticipate airfare fluctuations.  The company was formerly known as Hamlet (\"to buy or not to buy...that is the question\").  Farecast was acquired by Microsoft in 2008.  He was the Chief Technology Officer and a board member of Go2net (acquired by Infospace in 2000), and a co-founder of Netbot. (acquired by Excite in 1997). At Netbot, Etzioni helped to conceive and design the web's first major comparison-shopping agent. In 1995, Etzioni and his student Erik Selberg developed MetaCrawler, the web\u2019s premier Meta-search engine for several years \u2013 now being run by Infospace.  He is a co-founder of Clearforest, a text-mining startup (acquired by Reuters in 2007), and has served on the board of Performant (acquired by Mercury Interactive in 2003).  Finally, Etzioni has served as a consultant or advisor to Google, Microsoft, Northern Telecom, SAIC, Infospace, Excite, Askjeeves, Zillow, Vivisimo, and others. \n\nIn 1991, Etzioni launched the Internet Softbots project, and in 2003 he launched the KnowItAll project. \nYou have to wonder what he was doing in the intervening 12 years...\n\n\nIn 1997, Etzioni's joint paper on the Ahoy! Softbot was the runner-up for best paper award in WWW6, alas the award itself was snagged by Alta Vista. \nIn 2004, his joint paper on Semantic Email was a runner-up for the best paper award in WWW13... \nAn actual award is coming any day now...really...wait...A Probabilistic Model of Redundancy in Information Extraction snagged the\nDistinguished Paper Award at IJCAI 2005.\n\n\n\n\nEtzioni has been serving as a director of  the non-profit AI Access Foundation  since 1993. The foundation was created by Steve Minton to publish the Journal of AI Research --- one of the very first electronic journals distributed over the Web.

Gene comes to the JFRC from UC Berkeley where he was on the faculty of Computer Science from 2003 to 2005. He was formerly Vice President of Informatics Research at Celera Genomics for four years where he and his team determined the sequences of the Drosophila, Human, and Mouse genomes using the whole genome shotgun technique that he advocated in 1996. Prior to that Gene was on the faculty of the University of Arizona for 17 years and he received his Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Colorado in 1981. His research interests include the design and analysis of algorithms for problems in computational molecular biology, discrete pattern matching and computer graphics, with a focus on building models of the cell and cellular systems from imaging data. He is best known for the development of BLAST -- the most widely used tool in bioinformatics, and for the paired-end whole genome shotgun sequencing protocol and the assembler he developed at Celera that delivered the fly, human, and mouse genomes in a three year period. He has also written many seminal papers on the theory of sequence comparison. He was awarded the IEEE 3rd Millenium Acheivement Award in 2000, the Newcomb Cleveland Best Paper in Science award in 2001, and the ACM Kanellakis Prize in 2002. He was voted the most influential in bioinformatics in 2001 by Genome Technology Magazine and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2003. In 2004 he won the International Max-Planck Research Prize and in 2005 was selected as one of two distinguished alumni (with David Haussler) at his alma-mater, the University of Colorado. In 2006 Gene was inducted into Leopoldina, the German Academy of Science and awarded an honarary doctorate at ETH, Zurich.",

I was previously with Microsoft Reseach Redmond for 8.5 years. My research interests lie broadly in networked systems. My current work centers on (a) the intersection of sensor systems and mobile computing, and separately on (b) network management. My past projects have spanned a range of areas, including network measurement, wireless networking, RFID, geolocation, network tomography, and peer-to-peer networking. The technologies developed in some of these projects (e.g., the ProbeGap bandwidth probing tool and the GeoCluster technique for learning IP-location mapping) have been transferred to Microsoft's product groups while others (e.g., the RADAR WLAN-based user localization system) have been made available through Microsoft's technology licensing program.\n\nI obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley in September 1998. Professor Randy Katz was my advisor. I had previously obtained an M.S. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 1995 (advised by Professor Domenico Ferrari) and a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1993. \n\nMy Ph.D. thesis, titled Addressing the Challenges of Web Data Transport, proposed two novel techniques, TCP Session and TCP Fast Start, to bridge the disconnect between HTTP and TCP. These techniques provided an alternative to my prior work on persistent-connection HTTP (P-HTTP) done during my internship with Dr. Jeffrey Mogul at the DEC Western Research Lab (now part of HP Labs). The ideas of persistent connections and pipelining in P-HTTP have since been adopted by the IETF HTTP/1.1 standard (RFC 2616).\n\nDetailed lists of my publications, talks, and patents appear on separate pages.",

We take a very integrated approach including theoretical and ecological aspects such as application of mathematical models to field data. While in the field we collect physiological samples from free-living animals, and experimentally manipulate phenotypes (through hormone implants) to tease out mechanisms of control. These data are then integrated with laboratory experiments under rigorously controlled conditions. Endocrine techniques are applied to samples collected both in the field and laboratory and investigations at the cell and molecular level are encouraged. Additional emphasis is emerging in the area of conservation biology and what field endocrinology can contribute to this more applied aspect of biology. My laboratory works primarily with birds, although all vertebrate groups are of interest. Further details can be obtained at our web site.\nMy ongoing projects include the Arctic work, a seasonal breeding project (including field work from equatorial regions to the pole), and a high altitude project looking at hormone-behavior adaptations. Details of some of these studies can be found on my web site. The main thrust of my research is to understand how animals deal with changing environments and adjust their life cycles accordingly. This has led to the initiation of environmental endocrinology that includes a strong theoretical background so we can compare life cycles of all vertebrates from fish to mammals. This framework allows us to keep common mechanisms in mind and make the appropriate experimental comparisons. At present I see a great need to develop molecular techniques to address organismal problems. Specifically, we are pursuing have hormone receptor/metabolising enzyme genes are involved in hormone-behavior adaptations in diverse habitats. Additionally, I think molecular techniques will be important for us to assess population genetics so we can determine whether population differences in hormone-behavior interactions are genetic or environmentally-induced.\nPublications\uff1a\nLancaster, L.T., McAdam, A.G., Wingfield, J.C., & Sinervo, B.

Cantley (born February 20, 1949) is an American cell biologist and biochemist and a professor in the Departments of Systems Biology and Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and the Director of Cancer Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, in Boston, Massachusetts. Among his research contributions are the discovery and study of the enzyme PI-3-kinase, now known to be important to understanding cancer and diabetes mellitus.[1][2] He has recently moved to Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.\nCantley grew up in West Virginia, remaining in West Virginia at Wesleyan College where he graduated summa cum laude in chemistry in 1971. Cantley obtained his Ph.D. at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he worked with Gordon Hammes on enzyme kinetics, using FRET to study enzyme conformational changes. In 1975 he moved to Harvard University for a postdoctoral fellowship under Guido Guidotti, where he discovered that an impurity in commercial preparations of ATP, vanadate, acts as a transition state analog for phosphate hydrolysis. In 1978 Cantley became assistant professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Harvard, being promoted to associate professor in 1981. In 1985 he became a full professor in physiology at Tufts University School of Medicine. In 1985 Cantley and colleagues Malcolm Whitman, David Kaplan, Tom Roberts, and Brian Schaffhausen made the seminal discovery of the existence of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). In 1992, Cantley moved to Harvard Medical School as a Professor of Cell Biology and the Director of the Division of Signal Transduction at the former Beth Israel Hospital (now Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). In 2003, Cantley became a founding member of the newly formed Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School. In 2007, Cantley also became the Director of Cancer Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\nCantley is married to Vicki Sato, herself a prominent figure in the pharmaceutical industry and a Professor at Harvard University.",

I am particularly interested in the overlap between natural language understanding and reasoning. While most of the NLP field has moved to statistical learning methods as the paradigm for language processing, I believe that deep language understanding can only currently be achieved by significant hand-engineering of semantically-rich formalisms coupled with statistical preferences. For further discussion of this viewpoint, see the state of NLP . For a more general discussion of AI, see my keynote address from the 1998 AAAI National conference here . The TRIPS project is a long-term effort to build generic technology for dialogue systems (both spoken and 'chat' systems), which we have now pursued for over a decade. This includes broad -coverage domain-general natural language processing, dialogue agents built using models of collaborative problem solving, dynamic context-sensitive language modeling, and a rich engineering framework for building dialogue systems in new domains in short times. We can build robust spoken dialogue systems in significantly less time than it would take to collect and annotate a small starter corpora that would be needed for machine-learning driven approaches. \n",

Recently, he developed novel methods for calculating the electronic properties of semiconductor quantum nanostructures. These atomistic methods have enabled Zunger and his team to discover a range of many-body effects underlying the fundamental physics of the creation, multiplication, and annihilation of excitons.\n\nHis works have established the fundamental understanding of a wide range of materials phenomena in photovoltaic utilization of solar energy materials. The foundational methods he developed in the quantum theory of solids now form an essential integral part of the worldwide activities in the broad field of \u201cFirst-Principles Theory of Real Solids.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Zunger has focused on developing the \u201cInverse Band Structure\u201d concept, whereby one uses ideas from quantum mechanics as well as genetic algorithms to search for atomic configurations that have a desired target property.

            "bio": "Judah Folkman was born Moses Judah Folkman in 1933.  The son of a rabbi, he became inspired to become a physician as a young boy when visiting ailing members of the congregation with his father.  He soon became fascinated with science and medicine, and as a high school student he devised a perfusion system in his basement that maintained the viability of a beating rat heart for days after surgical removal.  This led to his admission at age 15 to nearby Ohio State University, where Judah worked part-time all four years in the surgical laboratory of Dr. Robert Zollinger.  He quickly mastered surgical skills and became an active participant in the exciting world of academic surgery.  Judah entered Harvard Medical School at 19, where he was welcomed into the laboratory of Dr. Robert Gross, then Surgeon-in-Chief at Children\u2019s Hospital.  There, he invented the first implantable heart pacemaker.  Based on his scientific contributions, Judah was elected to the AOA and received the Boylston Medical Prize, Soma Weiss Award, and Borden Undergraduate Research Award in Medicine, when he graduated magna cum laude from HMS in 1957.\nJudah authored some 400 peer-reviewed papers and more than 100 book chapters and monographs.  Over 38,000 articles have been published on angiogenesis, the field that he pioneered. He received scores of awards and honors for his distinguished research, including the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Christopher Columbus Discovery Award in Biomedical Research, American Cancer Society\u2019s Medal of Honor for Basic Science, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Award For Distinguished Achievement in Cancer Research, HMS\u2019s Warren Alpert Prize, Canada\u2019s Gairdner Foundation International Award, Israel\u2019s Wolf Foundation Prize in Medicine, Germany\u2019s Ernst Schering Prize, the Italian Association of Cancer Research in Rome\u2019s Gold Medal, the United Kingdom Society for Endocrinology\u2019s Dale Medal, and Switzerland\u2019s Dr. Josef Steiner Cancer Research Award.  Judah also was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Philosophical Society, and membership on the President\u2019s Cancer Advisory Board, in addition to receiving numerous honorary degrees from leading universities around the world. The research lab he founded with a single assistant when he arrived at Children\u2019s Hospital in 1967 had, by the time of his death, grown into a 125 scientist-strong Vascular Biology Program.  And, more than 1000 labs around the world are now pursuing angiogenesis research, yielding thousands of angiogenesis-related publications each year.\nJudah Folkman was an inspirational leader in everything that he did.  For those of us who were blessed with the chance to work closely with him, we remember Judah best for his warmth, his humor, and his incredible mentoring skills.  He mentored from the first light of day until his head hit the pillow and probably thereafter in his dreams.  Most of all, however, Judah mentored by the example of his perseverance, his willingness to move in different directions, and his sheer boyish delight in discovery. Whereas most people saw a lump of coal and spurned others who strived to look further, Judah walked forth boldly, turned it over and found a diamond.  He did this with experiments, but more importantly, he did this with people, whether patients, students, technicians, workmen, colleagues or competitors.  His death on January 14, 2008 was a terrible loss to our community, and to the entire world.  We will all miss him greatly.",

            "bio": "Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., is the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a position he has held since late 2009. Previously, he served as the NHGRI Scientific Director (2002-2009), chief of the NHGRI Genome Technology Branch (1996-2009), and director of the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (1997-2009).\n\nBorn and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Dr. Green comes from a scientific family. His father, Maurice Green, Ph.D., is a virologist at St. Louis University School of Medicine, where he has directed the Institute for Molecular Virology for over five decades. His brother, Michael Green, M.D., Ph.D., is a molecular biologist at the University of Massachusetts-Worcester, where he chairs the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Cancer Biology and is an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nDr. Green received his B.S. degree in bacteriology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1981, and his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Washington University in 1987. During residency training in clinical pathology (laboratory medicine), he worked in the laboratory of Dr. Maynard Olson, where he launched his career in genomics research. In 1992, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Pathology and Genetics as well as a co-investigator in the Human Genome Center at Washington University. In 1994, he joined the newly established Intramural Research Program of the National Center for Human Genome Research, later renamed the National Human Genome Research Institute.\n\nHonors given to Dr. Green include a Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (1989-1990), a Lucille P. Markey Scholar Award in Biomedical Science (1990-1994), induction into the American Society for Clinical Investigation (2002), an Alumni Achievement Award from Washington University School of Medicine (2005), induction into the Association of American Physicians (2007), a Distinguished Alumni Award from Washington University (2010), the Cotlove Lectureship Award from the Academy of Clinical Laboratory Physicians and Scientists (2011), a Ladue Horton Watkins High School Distinguished Alumni Award (2012), and the Wallace H. Coulter Lectureship Award from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (2012). He is a founding editor of the journal Genome Research (1995-present) and a series editor for Genome Analysis: A Laboratory Manual (1994-1998), both published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. He is also co-editor of the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics (since 2005). Dr. Green has authored and co-authored over 340 scientific publications.\n\nWhile directing an independent research program for almost two decades, Dr. Green was at the forefront of efforts to map, sequence and understand eukaryotic genomes. His work included significant, start-to-finish involvement in the Human Genome Project. These efforts eventually blossomed into a highly productive program in comparative genomics that provided important insights about genome structure, function and evolution. His laboratory also identified and characterized several human disease genes, including those implicated in certain forms of hereditary deafness, vascular disease and inherited peripheral neuropathy.",

            "bio": "Prof. David Harel is a professor of computer science at the Weizmann Institute of Science and is Vice-President-elect of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He has been at Weizmann since 1980, and is incumbent of the William Sussman Professorial Chair. He was Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from 1989 to 1995, and was Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science from 1998 for seven years.\n\nHe received a BSc from Bar-Ilan University (1974), an MSc from Tel-Aviv University (1976) and a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1978). He spent two years at IBM's Yorktown Heights research center, sabbatical years at Carnegie-Mellon University, Cornell University and the University of Edinburgh, and shorter visiting positions at IBM, Lucent Technologies Bell Labs, DEC, NASA, University of Birmingham, Verimag, the National University of Singapore and Microsoft Research Cambridge. From 1991 to1999 he was an adjunct professor at the Open University of Israel. He was also co-founder of  I-Logix, Inc. in 1984, which was acquired by Telelogic in 2006, and which, in turn, was acquired by IBM in 2008.\n\nIn the past he has worked in several areas of theoretical computer science, including computability theory (see, e.g., this paper and this paper), logics of programs (see, e.g., this book), database theory (see, e.g., this paper), and automata theory (see, e.g., this paper). Over the years, his activity in these areas diminished, and he became involved in several other areas, including software and systems engineering, visual languages, layout of diagrams, modeling and analysis of biological systems, and the synthesis and communication of smell. He has published widely on these topics (see list of publications), including several books. He is the inventor of the language of statecharts (see the 1984 paper for the original version of the language, which has over 8000 citations, the 1997 paper for the OO version, and this paper on its history), and co-inventor of live sequence charts (LSCs; see the 1998 paper), the idea of reactive animation (2002) and behavioral programming (2010). He was part of the team that designed the tools Statemate (1984-1987), Rhapsody (1997) the Play-Engine (2003) and PlayGo (2010). His work is also central to the UML.  He has put forward visions/grand challenges for liberating programming (see this paper), for modeling an entire multi-cellular organism (see this paper), for a system of odor communication and synthesis (see this paper), and recently for wise computing (see this paper).\n\nHe has devoted part of his time to educational and expository work: In 1984 he delivered a lecture series on Israeli radio (see the book version), and in 1998 he hosted a series of programs on Israeli television. Some of his writing is intended for a general audience; see, for example, Computers Ltd.: What They Really Can't Do (2000, 2012) and  Algorithmics: The Spirit of Computing (1987, 1992, 2004, 2012).\n\nHis awards include the ACM Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award (1992), the Stevens Award in Software Development Methods (1996), the Israel Prize (2004), the ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award (2006), the ACM Software System Award (2007), the ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award (2008), the Emet Prize (2010) and the ABZ Platinum Gold Medal from ETH Zurich (2013).\n\nHe has received honorary degrees from the University of Rennes (2005), the Open University of Israel (2006), the University of Milano-Bicocca (2007), the Technical University of Eindhoven (2012) and Bet Berl College (2014). He is a Fellow of the ACM (1994), the IEEE (1995), and the AAAS (2007), and is a member of the Academia Europaea (2006) and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (2010; Vice President as of Sept. 2015), and a foreign member of the US National Academy of Engineering (2014), and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2014).\n\nHe is an ardent peace and human rights activist, and his main hobby is photography.",

Three years later he started his grand tour with Fred Richards at Yale, Michael Levitt at the Weizmann Intitute and Joel Janin at the Institut Pasteur. Cyrus and Michael developed the \"all-a, all-b, a/b and a+b\" classification of protein structures, and with Joel, he determined principles that underlie protein-protein recognition and packing of protein secondary structures.\n\nCyrus returned to Cambridge in 1976, attached to the LMB and UCL, and was the E.P.A. Cephalosporin Fund Senior Research Fellow of the Royal Society until 1990. He and Arthur Lesk showed that proteins adapt to mutations by changes in structure; described how distant protein sites transmit information; and showed that the sequence of immunoglobulin hypervariable regions can predict their conformation. Cyrus collaborated with Alexey Murzin, Steven Brenner and Tim Hubbard to create the SCOP database in 1995, and with Julian Gough he created the SUPERFAMILY database in 2002.",

            "bio": "Mukherjee has exploited various mediums to get this message across, most recently by allowing an instructive 2010 lecture \u2014 titled How to Be a Good Graduate Student \u2014 to circulate on the Internet, as a YouTube video.\n\nNo surprise, then, that Mukherjee earned a 2004 Graduate Mentoring Award, granted by the UC Davis Academic Senate on the basis of how an instructor encourages intellectual growth, offers accessibility to students, and demonstrates quality scholarship. In 2009, he also was honored with the UC Davis College of Engineering\u2019s Outstanding Senior Faculty Award.\n\nDuring his career at UC Davis, Mukherjee has supervised to completion the doctorate dissertations of nearly 50 students, and currently is supervising roughly 20 Ph.D. students and research scholars. His students typically achieve a high rate of productivity, publishing in from three to five journals per year; over time, many students have been nominated for the College of Engineering\u2019s \u201cbest dissertation\u201d award.\n\nAdditionally, Mukherjee tirelessly helps his students prepare for their careers, and actively involves himself in their job searches.\n\nMukherjee obtained his undergraduate degree in electronics and electrical communications engineering \u2014 with honors \u2014 in 1980, at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in his native India. He then moved to the United States and obtained back-to-back master\u2019s degrees in computer science and electrical engineering, both at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. This was followed by a Ph.D., also in electrical engineering, from the University of Washington, Seattle. Immediately upon completing his doctorate, in 1987, he joined the UC Davis College of Engineering.\n\nHe quickly established a strong reputation for his work with optical networks and security protocols: specifically, lightwave networks, with the goal of developing novel architectures, protocols and algorithms for the next generation of high-speed networks designed to exploit wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical technology; network intrusion detection, with the goal of detecting network software vulnerabilities and attacks in real time; and wireless and sensor networks. Mukherjee became renowned for his knowledge in these areas, and has become a popular speaker at optical networking conferences throughout the world. He recently served as general co-chair of the 2011 Optical Fibers Communication Conference, held in Los Angeles, and gave keynote/plenary talks at similar conferences held in Cartagena, Spain, and Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nHe also has been a prolific author during his quarter-century at UC Davis, with a staggering list of published articles and research papers to his credit. His graduate-level textbook, 2006\u2019s Optical WDM Networks, remains an invaluable resource to this day; the 956-page book is part of Springer\u2019s Optical Networks series, which Mukherjee edits. He also serves \u2014 or has served \u2014 on the editorial boards of eight journals, including IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking and IEEE Network. He was made an IEEE Fellow in 2006.\n\nHe served as chair of the UC Davis Department of Computer Science from 1997 through 2000, and in 2005 was appointed to the College of Engineering\u2019s Child Family Professorship, an endowed position that was established to foster academic excellence and innovative research in \u201cthe interrelationship of engineering and entrepreneurship.\u201d Upon receiving that professorship, Mukherjee was cited as \u201can outstanding scholar and teacher, (with) the key industry connections that carry his academic research to practical application.\u201d\n\nOutside academia, Mukherjee was a five-year founding member of the board of directors of IPLocks Inc., a Silicon Valley startup. He also served on technical advisory boards for several other networking startups, including Teknovus, Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems, and LookAhead Decisions Inc.\n\nSomehow, Mukherjee also finds time for several sporting activities each week, with regular games of soccer and squash. In that realm, he\u2019s proudest of his long affiliation with the Davis Cricket Club and the Northern California Cricket League; he\u2019s quick to regale listeners with a memorable game that took place on June 8, 1997, when he and a teammate recorded an unbroken, 280-run opening partnership in an NCCA \u201cB\u201d League game. As a result of that remarkable performance, Mukherjee earned that year\u2019s \u201cB\u201d League Single-Inning Batting Trophy: an honor he probably cherishes just as much as \u2014 if not more than \u2014 his many academic awards.",

Levine is currently a Professor Emeritus at The Simons Center for Systems Biology at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and a joint Professor in the Pediatrics and Biochemistry Departments at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey. He received his B.A. in Biology from Harpur College, SUNY and his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. \n\nHe trained as a Postdoctoral Fellow at California Institute of Technology in the laboratory of Robert Sinsheimer. Dr. Levine is a widely acclaimed leader in cancer research. In 1979, Dr. Levine and others discovered the p53 tumor suppressor protein, a molecule that inhibits tumor development. He established the Simons Center for Systems Biology at the Institute for Advanced Study, which concentrates on research at the interface of molecular biology and the physical sciences: on genetics and genomics, polymorphisms and molecular aspects of evolution, signal transduction pathways and networks, stress responses, and pharmacogenomics in cancer biology. Dr. Levine helped shape U.S. science priorities as chairman of an influential 1996 review panel on federal AIDS research funding. He also chaired the National Cancer Advisory Board, which advises the National Academy of Sciences and its Institute of Medicine on cancer policy. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1991 and to its Institute of Medicine in 1995. In April 2001, Levine received the first Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research, the largest annual prize in science or medicine offered in the United States.  In 1968 Dr. Levine joined Princeton University as an Assistant Professor, becoming a Professor of biochemistry in 1976.  In 1979, he moved to the SUNY Stony Brook School of Medicine to Chair the Department of Microbiology. He returned to Princeton in 1984. Between 1984 and 1996, he presided over a major expansion of Princeton\u2019s life sciences programs as Chairman of the Department of Molecular Biology. From 1998 to 2002, Dr. Levine was President of The Rockefeller University.",

Kosslyn is Dean of Arts and Sciences at the Minerva Schools at KGI, as well as John Lindsley Professor of Psychology in Memory of William James, Emeritus, in Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n\nKosslyn received his original graduate training in cognitive science, which focused on the intersection of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. Faced with limitations in those approaches, he eventually turned to studying the brain, and is one of the founders of the field of cognitive neuroscience. Research in the Kosslyn Laboratory focused primarily on the nature of visual mental imagery, visual perception, and visual communication, as well as on the uses of imagery in cognition more generally, and on individual and group differences in imagery ability. Convergent methodologies were employed, ranging from behavioral studies to neuroimaging research to computational models.",

Through his studies of apoptosis, Korsmeyer helped develop the concepts of the role of programmed cell death in carcinogenesis. In 1989 Korsmeyer was among the first to confirm that a particular form of lymphoma arose in certain B cells because they had a genetic flaw that caused them to overexpress a gene, Bcl-2, that was involved in the body's normal process for getting rid of them. He then conducted a number of studies defining the activity of a number of related genes and their role in apoptosis.\n\nKorsmeyer obtained a medical doctorate from the University of Illinois at Chicago, completed a residency at the University of California Hospitals in California, and then trained at the National Cancer Institute under Thomas A. Waldmann and Philip Leder. He then became a tenured professor, first at Washington University and then at Harvard at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, working within the Howard Hughes Medical Institute while at both universities. He was widely respected in the field and received numerous prestigious cancer research awards, including the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Cancer Research and the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation Charles S. Mott Prize. He was an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Philosophical Society. The American Society for Clinical Investigation has established a scientific award in his name. In 2000 he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize by Columbia University.\n\nHe has been credited as the author of nearly 20 articles published since his death from cancer in 2005.",

He was fascinated by the possibility of strengthening immunity to pathogens with continually improving methods of immunization. At the beginning of his academic career, Hermann Wagner was working on mechanisms to activate killer T cells and the role played by bacterial superantigens. He completed his research residency in Melbourne at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1973 with a doctoral dissertation about T cell mediated immune responses. At TUM, he worked to make \u201cinfection immunology\u201d one of the academic concentrations of the medicine department. In 1995 he was one of the first scientists to discover the importance of toll-like receptors (TLRs) for research into infections and immunology. Having published more than 370 works, Hermann Wagner is one of the most frequently cited immunologists in Europe. He has served as honorary president of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Immunologie (German Society for Immunology), dean of the School of Medicine at TUM and chair of the academic advisory council of the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research in W\u00fcrzburg (IZKF).",

            "bio": "Gregory D. Abowd (pronounced AY-bowd) is the Distinguished Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. His research interests concern how the advanced information technologies of ubiquitous computing (or ubicomp) impact our everyday lives when they are seamlessly integrated into our living spaces. Dr. Abowd's work has involved schools and homes, with a recent focus on healthcare delivery. He is a member of the GVU Center.\n\nDr. Abowd currently serves as the Director of the Health Systems Institute, a joint Georgia Tech/Emory University research institute investigating the impact of technologies on healthcare delivery. This extends his own work over the past decade on information technologies and autism.\n\nDr. Abowd directs the Ubiquitous Computing Research Group in the School of Interactive Computing. This effort started with the Future Computing Environments research group in 1995, and has since matured into a collection of research groups, including Dr. Abowd's own group. One of the major research efforts that Dr. Abowd initated is the Aware Home Research Initiative, which he founded in 2000 and directed until 2008.\n\nDr. Abowd received the degree of B.S. in Mathematics in 1986 from the University of Notre Dame. He then attended the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom on a Rhodes Scholarship, earning the degrees of M.Sc. (1987) and D.Phil. (1991) in Computation from the Programming Research Group in the Computing Laboratory. From 1989-1992 he was a Research Associate/Postdoc with the Human-Computer Interaction Group in the Department of Computer Science at the University of York in England. From 1992-1994, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Software Engineering Institute and the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nIn the Fall of 1999, the Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine did a profile on Dr. Abowd and some of his research from the 1990's. You can read the article here. Much more news about his research group, both personal and professional, can be found here.",

They are also exploring the contribution of epigenetic modifications and non-coding RNA pathways in complex diseases, mainly neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. They approach these questions through very well characterized cohorts of patients and the use of high-throughput genomic platforms and functional studies including longitudinal studies of patients at different time-points and cohorts in which exposure to environment has been monitored.",

She is interested in factors that contribute to both positive and negative outcomes (and changes in well-being) across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, with a particular focus on key social and biological transitions (in schooling, family structure and dynamics, parenthood, and puberty, sexual onset, and pregnancy) over the life course. Brooks-Gunn has also designed and evaluated interventions aimed at enhancing the well-being of children living in poverty and associated conditions. She has published over 500 articles and chapters, written 4 books, edited 13 volumes, and been the recipient of numerous major awards and honors.

These include the Early Head Start Follow-Up Study, which is evaluating outcomes at age 10 for children who had participated in Early Head Start as infants or toddlers; researchers are assessing the children, interviewing their mothers, and sending questionnaires to their teachers. She is also conducting a long-term follow-up of the Infant Health and Development Program, an eight-site randomized trial assessing the efficacy of early childhood education and home visiting on the outcomes of low birth-weight children (followed through age 18). She is also conducting a series of studies and evaluations of After School Matters (looking at the effects of extracurricular activities, community activities, and extended day programs on well-being in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood). She is one of the PIs for the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, a study of 7,000 children in 80 neighborhoods over an eight-year period. Current analyses are focusing on ethnic, gender, immigrant, and neighborhood influences on the timing of puberty, sexual onset, and pregnancy, and on changes in anxious, depressive, and aggressive behaviors from ages 3 to 20 (looking at the subjective weathering hypothesis). Brooks-Gunn is also spearheading the Child Care, Schooling and Parental Employment in Fragile Families project, which is adding a child care module to the Fragile Families Study, including child assessments and interviews with providers and parents. She is also responsible for the component of Fragile Families focusing on the schooling experiences of children (school and teacher characteristics, and child school behavior including achievement, attention, and behavior problems). Brooks-Gunn has numerous papers in progress with various collaborators; topics include variation in child care type and quality, predictors of child emotional self-regulation, race/ethnic differences in childhood overweight and obesity, Head Start experiences and child outcomes, maternal employment and child development, father involvement and child behavior, family structure and parenting behaviors, early feeding practices as a function of family structure, immigration status, education, and employment status (as well as the consequences for infant health), and trajectories of couple relationship quality and parenting.",

Part of his group studies the photochemistry of vision and other photoactivated reactions with femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering, which enables the structural characterization of short-lived intermediate states in chemical reactions. Another part of his group works on the development of microfabricated biochemical analysis systems; portions of this work had a significant impact on the sequencing of the human genome. Microfabricated analysis systems are also being developed for forensic analysis, clinical analysis and space exploration. He has authored or co-authored over 450 publications and patents.",

The University's chaos research group, one of the best in the world. The objective of his chaos research is to describe those robust properties that are common in the dynamics of physical, biological, and chemical systems. Sometimes the phenomena can be described using rigorous mathematics, and sometimes only phenomenological descriptions can be obtained from intensive numerical studies. Most often, the research is a blend of numerical and rigorous techniques.",

He has been on the faculty\nat Carnegie Mellon since 1984, starting as an Assistant Professor and\nprogressing to his current rank of University Professor of Computer\nScience.  He also holds a courtesy appointment in the Electrical and\nComputer Engineering Department.  He served as Dean of the School of\nComputer Science from 2004 to 2014.\n\nDr. Bryant's research focuses on methods for formally verifying\ndigital hardware, and more recently some forms of software.  His 1986\npaper on symbolic Boolean manipulation using Ordered Binary Decision\nDiagrams (BDDs) has the highest citation count of any publication in\nthe Citeseer database of computer science literature.  In addition, he\nhas developed several techniques to verify circuits by symbolic\nsimulation, with levels of abstraction ranging from transistors to\nvery high-level representations.\n\nDr. Bryant has received widespread recognition for his work.  He is a\nfellow of the IEEE and the ACM, as well as a member of the National\nAcademy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Science.\nHis awards include the 1997 ACM Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award\n(shared with Edmund M. Clarke, Ken McMillan, and Allen Emerson) for\ncontributing to the development of symbolic model checking, as well as\nthe 1989 IEEE W.R.G. Baker Prize for the best paper appearing in any\nIEEE publication during the preceding year.\n\nDr. Bryant teaches courses in computer systems.  Along with David\nR. O'Hallaron, he developed a novel approach to teaching about the\nhardware, networking, and system software that comprise a system from\nthe perspective of an advanced programmer, rather than from those of\nthe system designers.  Their textbook ``Computer Systems: A\nProgrammer's Perspective,'' now in its second edition, is in use at\nover 250 universities worldwide, with translations into Chinese,\nKorean, Macedonian, and Russian.\n\nDr. Bryant received his B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the\nUniversity of Michigan in 1973, and his PhD from MIT in 1981.  He was\non the faculty at Caltech from 1981 to 1984.",

Fundamental distinctions between such ground states imply that they cannot be smoothly connected to each other (whereas the Landau Fermi liquid is smoothly connected to the independent electron state). Such states are necessarily separated by quantum phase transitions at a quantum critical point (QCP). The QCP has novel properties and usually does not permit a quasiparticle description. Although the QCP is only a special point in the zero temperature phase diagram, it turns out to be a useful point of departure for understanding the physical properties of phases in its vicinity both at zero and non-zero temperatures. Remarkably, it is often the case that quantum mechanics is crucial to understanding the collective properties of 1023 electrons in these materials, even at temperatures as high as room temperature and at the longest time and distance scales.",

            "bio": "John Clifford Mitchell is professor of computer science and (by courtesy) electrical engineer at Stanford University. He has published in the area of programming language theory and computer security.\n\nJohn C. Mitchell is the Vice Provost for Online Learning at Stanford University, the Mary and Gordon Crary Family Professor in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, co-director of the Stanford Computer Security Lab, and Professor (by courtesy) of Education.Under Mitchell's direction, the Office of the Vice Provost for Online Learning (VPOL) is advancing teaching and learning through faculty driven online learning initiatives and research, transforming education in Stanford\u2019s classrooms and beyond.\n\nMitchell\u2019s first research project in online learning started in 2009 when he and six undergraduate students built Stanford CourseWare, an innovative platform that expanded to support interactive video and discussion. CourseWare served as the foundation for initial flipped classroom experiments at Stanford and helped inspire the first massive open online courses (MOOCs) from Stanford that captured worldwide attention in 2011.\n\nThe Office of the Vice Provost for Online Learning was as established in August 2012, after Mitchell served as Stanford University President John L. Hennessy\u2019s special assistant for educational technology and chaired a faculty committee that established initial priorities for Stanford and developed intellectual property guidelines for publicly released online courses.\n\nTo help build faculty experience and a catalogue of online material, Vice Provost Mitchell launched a faculty seed grant program in Summer 2012. This program has helped faculty across campus transform their Stanford campus courses and release public courses to the world, generating informed discussion and debate among faculty in the process.\n\nVPOL offers faculty services in course design \u2014 including flipped classes, blended learning experiences, MOOCs, and SPOCs (small private online courses); audio and video production; platform evaluation and hosting; and runs its own data research efforts. VPOL also administers Stanford Online as the gateway to online learning at Stanford.\n\nIn addition to supporting delivery of digital course content, the VPOL engineering team is working to expand the features of Stanford OpenEdX, Stanford\u2019s instance of the open-source release of the edX platform. Mitchell and his team, in partnership with edX, announced the release of Open edX in June 2013: an open-source hosting platform, providing a customizable alternative for all colleges and universities and supporting open educational research and innovation.\n\nStanford\u2019s online courses are generating a wealth of course participant data. In collaboration with Stanford centers of scholarship such as the Lytics Lab, which is jointly supervised by Mitchell and Professor Roy Pea of the Graduate School of Education, VPOL is playing a key role in evaluating educational outcomes and improving online learning based on data-driven research and iterative design.\n\nIn May 2014, VPOL issued a comprehensive report to share benchmark information with other institutions of higher education.\n\n He has served on the editorial board of ten academic journals, acted as consultant and advisor to numerous companies, and spent sabbaticals at the Newton Institute for Mathematical Science and Coverity, Inc. Mitchell is the author of two books, over 170 research papers, and is among the most-cited scholars in computer science.",

His efforts have resulted in the development of concepts used in the popular Java programming language, improved the security of widely used wireless networking protocols, contributed to the security architecture of the Chrome browser and other components of the modern web.\n\nIn August 2012, Mitchell was appointed by Stanford President John L. Hennessy as the Vice Provost for Online Learning, a newly created position responsible for overseeing Stanford's online learning initiatives.",

Christine Van Broeckhoven does research on Alzheimer dementia, bipolar mental disorders and other neurological diseases. Since 1983 she has had her own laboratory for molecular genetics at the University of Antwerp, and since 2005 is focussing her research on neurodegenerative brain diseases.

We use massive parallel sequencing approaches including whole-genome/exome sequencing and large-scale targeted re-sequencing to identify rare disease-causing and disease-modifying mutations in selected patient cohorts with an apparent high genetic load. This multidisciplinary approach of clinical neurology and molecular genetics has put neurodegenerative brain disease research in Flanders Belgium at the international forefront, as exemplified by the discovery of two major genes for frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis i.e. progranulin (Cruts et al., Nature 2006) and C9orf72 (Gijselinck et al., Lancet Neurology 2012) which are presently under investigation for clinical trials; the observation of a cluster of rare genetic variations delineating the functional role of CLU in Alzheimer disease (Bettens et al., Molecular Neurodegeneration, 2012), and the identification of a functional copy-number-variation increasing the number of C3b/C4b binding sites in CR1 explaining its association with increased Alzheimer risk (Brouwers et al., Molecular Psychiatry 2012).\n\nWe will continue to invest in state-of-the-art strategies and combine our genomic sequencing approaches with additional methodologies including transcriptomics, methylomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Applying a multidimensional \u2018Integrative Neuromics\u2019 strategy will increase our molecular discovery efficiency and create multidimensional molecular signatures of neurodegeneration. These signatures will be instrumental in pinpointing candidate biomarkers (diagnostic) and drug targets (therapeutic discovery), as well as allow stratification of heterogeneous patient groups to select most relevant subgroups for eventual remediation trials.",

His work at the University of Utah focused on spacetime control for linked figure animation \n\nAt Microsoft, Dr. Cohen has worked on a number of projects ranging from image based rendering, to animation, to camera control, to more artistic non-photorealistic rendering. One project focuses on the problem of image based rendering; capturing the complete flow of light from an object for later rendering from arbitrary vantage points. This work, dubbed The Lumigraph is analogous to creating a digital hologram. Michael also has continued his work on linked figure animation, focusing on means to allow simulated creatures to portray their emotional state. Recent work has focused on computational photography applications. These ranged from creating new methods for low bandwidth teleconferencing, segmentation and matting of images and video, technologies for combining a set of \"image stacks\" as a Photomontage , to the creation of very high resolution panoramas.",

Until March 2003 he was Director of the Swiss Center for Scientific Computing (CSCS) in Manno.\n\n\nBorn in Messina, Italy, in 1945, he obtained his degree in physics in 1968 from Bologna, Italy. Prior to joining ETH, he was Director at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, and previous positions include research staff member at the IBM Research Laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland, and full professor at SISSA, Trieste, Italy.\n\n\nProfessor Parrinello-s scientific interests are strongly interdisciplinary and include the study of complex chemical reactions, hydrogen-bonded systems, catalysis and materials science. Together with Roberto Car he introduced the ab-initio molecular dynamics method, which he is still developing and applying. This method, which goes under the name of Car-Parrinello method, represents the beginning of a new field and has dramatically influenced the field of electronic structure calculations for solids, liquids and molecules. He is also known for the Parrinello-Rahman method of molecular dynamics, which permits the study of crystalline phase transitions under constant pressure. For his research he has been awarded numerous prizes, including the 2001 Award in Theoretical Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, the 1995 Rahman prize of the American Physical Society and the 1990 Hewlett-Packard Europhysics prize. He is an External Scientific Member of the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a Member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science and of the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften.",

            "work": "The Greengard laboratory studies the molecular defects responsible for neurological and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, as well as the molecular mechanisms by which neuro- and psychoactive drugs produce their pharmacological actions in these disorders. \n\nResearch from the Greengard laboratory has demonstrated that most neurotransmitters and neuromodulators achieve their actions and interactions on postsynaptic neurons through a process called \u201cslow synaptic transmission.\u201d This process involves activation of highly complex signal transduction cascades. For the last 10 years, the group has applied this knowledge to the study of the molecular pathways behind various neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n\nOne major area of activity in the Greengard laboratory involves a search for the molecular and cellular basis of major depressive disorder. They recently found a protein called p11 (S100A10, a member of the S100 family of proteins) that plays a central role in the regulation of mood. Constitutive removal of p11 from neurons in the brain causes a depressive phenotype and a loss of behavioral response to antidepressant agents. Deletion of p11 from one cell type in the nucleus accumbens causes the depressive phenotype, and deletion from any of three other cell types results in the loss of behavioral responses to antidepressants. The antidepressant action of p11 is mediated through binding of p11 to a chromatin-remodeling factor, SMARCA3. SMARCA3, in turn, through activation of various transcription factors, regulates gene transcription. One current project of the research group is to determine which of these genes is necessary for the therapeutic actions of various antidepressants and to determine the molecular mechanisms of action of these gene products.\n\nA second major area of interest of the laboratory is the analysis of the enzymatic pathways involved in the synthesis and degradation of amyloid-\u03b2, the prime suspect in the etiology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The enzyme \u03b3-secretase catalyzes the formation of amyloid-\u03b2, the substance believed to be responsible for the death of nerve cells in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In addition, \u03b3-secretase catalyzes the formation of notch and of many other proteins vital to cell function. The group has recently discovered a protein, which they named \u03b3-secretase activating protein (GSAP), that selectively activates the catalytic formation of amyloid-\u03b2 by \u03b3-secretase, but not of notch. As a result, inhibitors of GSAP selectively prevent formation of amyloid-\u03b2 without affecting formation of notch and other vital products. Therefore, GSAP represents a singularly attractive target for the development of drugs to inhibit amyloid-\u03b2 formation and thus prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease, without toxic side effects. In other studies in the laboratory, two pathways involved in regulation of amyloid-\u03b2 degradation have been found, and the mechanisms by which these pathways achieve their effects are being investigated.\n\nA third area of activity of the laboratory involves determining the molecular basis for the differences between vulnerable cells and non-vulnerable cells in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and in Parkinson\u2019s disease. This approach is based on identifying all expressed proteins in individual nerve cell types in the brain using bacTRAP technology, which was developed in collaboration with Rockefeller\u2019s Nathaniel Heintz. Proteins that are highly expressed in vulnerable cells are introduced to non-vulnerable cells to see if they cause vulnerability. Conversely, proteins that are highly expressed in non-vulnerable cells are introduced to vulnerable cells to see if they afford protection.",

She is a co-author of one of the more widely used long-lived description logic systems (CLASSIC) from Bell Laboratories. Her work on languages (including OWL, DAML+OIL, OIL, CLASSIC, etc.) is aimed at providing languages that enable the next generation of web applications moving from a web aimed at human consumption to the semantic web aimed at machine consumption in support of intelligent assistants and web agents. Deborah is a leader in ontology-based tools and applications. She is a co-author and technical leader of the Stanford KSL ontology evolution environment.

She also provided technical leadership for the Stanford project to help Cisco systems form its ontology evolution plan for its meta data formation work. \nDeborah's main research thrusts are in languages, tools, and environments for the semantic web. Deborah leads the Stanford Inference Web (IW) effort. IW provides a framework for increasing trust in answers from heterogeneous systems by explaining how the answers were derived and what they depended on. Inference Web supports this goal by providing infrastructure and an implemented web-based environment for storing, exchanging, combining, annotating, comparing, search for, validating, and rendering proofs and proof fragments provided by reasoners and query answering systems. Inference web is being used as an infrastructure for explanations in a number of DARPA, DTO, and NSF projects and in a few demonstration systems including the Explainable Semantic Discovery Service and the KSL wine agent. Deborah led the wine agent project as an early semantic web services demonstration system that integrates explanation (via Inference web), semantic web languages (via DAML+OIL and OWL), semantic web query languages (via OWL-QL), and web services (via OWL-S).",

Deborah is co-editor of the Ontology Web Language which has emerged from web ontology working group of the World Wide Web (W3C) semantic web activity and has now achieved W3C Recommendation status. She helped start the web ontology working group out of work as a co-author of the DARPA Agent Markup Language program's DAML language. She helped form the Joint EU/US Agent Markup Language Committee which evolved the DAML language into the DAML+OIL description logic-based ontology language. She is a co-author of one of the more widely used long-lived description logic systems (CLASSIC) from Bell Laboratories. Her work on languages (including OWL, DAML+OIL, OIL, CLASSIC, etc.) is aimed at providing languages that enable the next generation of web applications moving from a web aimed at human consumption to the semantic web aimed at machine consumption in support of intelligent assistants and web agents. Deborah is a leader in ontology-based tools and applications. She is a co-author and technical leader of the Stanford KSL ontology evolution environment. She also consulted to help VerticalNet design and build its Ontobuilder/Ontoserver ontology evolution environment. She also provided technical leadership for the Stanford project to help Cisco systems form its ontology evolution plan for its meta data formation work.",
